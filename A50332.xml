            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS in many of his Actions the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil expreſſes an Emulation of the divine power and greatneſs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to reſemble the moſt high: In the production of Schiſm, he tries to counterfeit the Creation. For as God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this world out of nothing, his power ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating without any matter: So the Devil too creates a Schiſm from colour, or the ſhadow of a pretence, or whatever elſe may be thought to ſtand in a nearer degree to nothing.</p>
            <p>Now it is the common way to judge of the nature of Schiſm, by the quality of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; if this be ſlight and frivolous, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the other cannot be dangerous, and must be in a near diſpoſition to admit a Cure. But common experience proves this to be a
<pb facs="tcp:95441:4"/>
miſtake: For on the contrary, where the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of difference ſeems to be moſt trifling, there we may obſerve the animoſities to be higheſt. And the reaſon is plain enough; for he who is reſolved to force a quarrel, will lay hold on any pretence; and the more frivolous it is, the more bitterneſs and rancour it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers in that <hi>Spirit that luſteth to envy.</hi> And at the ſame time, it is a good teſtimony of the integrity and exactneſs of the party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which the quarrel is affected, that thoſe who were reſolved to break, are forced to take up with ſo mean Cavils.</p>
            <p>When you have done all you can to remove occaſion from thoſe who ſeek offence, the Prediction of our Lord and his Apoſtles will continue to be accompliſhed. Offences will come, and Hereſies and Schiſms muſt be; and thoſe who are ſincere will be made manifeſt, and thoſe who are otherwiſe will not be hid. The Enemy of Chriſtian peace does confirm the Goſpel, while he endeavours to deſtroy it by diviſions; as the <hi>Jews</hi> fulfilled the Prophets by condemning the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> While the Church remained under the conduct of the Apoſtles, in the ſimplicity of the Chriſtian Faith, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs of Diſcipline, it might be expected there ſhould be no Diſſenters. But thoſe golden times, for our comfort, have left us their complaints, that then, <hi>there were railings, evil ſurmiſes, and perverſe diſputings of men of corrupt
<pb facs="tcp:95441:4"/>
minds, and deſtitute of the truth;</hi> even then <hi>there were falſe Apoſtles, deceitful Workers, transforming themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt.</hi> Then as well as now, there were ſome <hi>who ſeparated themſelves,</hi> and <hi>forſook the Aſſemblies</hi> of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> the popular and complying Apoſtle, who <hi>became all things to all men,</hi> had no ſmall ſtruggle with this ſpirit of Separation. Some were ſuch proficients in a free cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as to <hi>think of him as though he walked according to the fleſh;</hi> ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparaged his Gifts, and deſpiſed <hi>his bodily preſence as weak, and his ſpeech con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible;</hi> detracting from him doubtleſs, to add to themſelves the character of <hi>more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,</hi> and more <hi>edifying Teachers.</hi> Some were <hi>puffed up,</hi> deſpiſed his authority, and made diviſions in the Churches under his care. He who healed all manner of diſeaſes, who raiſed the dead, and could caſt out a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſpirit of Divination, found it a harder matter to deal with the ſpirit of ſeparation, that operated in the ſuch falſe Prophets as bore the forms and titles of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>The Divine providence permitted many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacks in our Saviour's and the Apoſtles time, when God conferred miraculous abilities to diſpoſſeſs them; but ſeems to have ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:95441:5"/>
the chain of evil Spirits in ſucceeding ages, in the ſame proportion that he leſſened the gifts by which they were maſtered. But the Spirit of ſeparation was still ſuffered to practice his Arts of deluding, and to break the peace of the Church, by infinite variety of pretences. Sometimes it was too pure for the mixed ſociety of the Church; ſometimes it was exalted with new Revelations, and thoſe who would not receive them were carnal; and in ſhort, was ſo diligent in inventing reaſons, and in ſnatching occaſions of dividing Communion, that all the Topicks of Schiſm ſeemed to be exhauſted.</p>
            <p>But this Spirit it ſeems will not be stinted, nor confine its ſelf within its own ancient Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents. For in theſe laſt times it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nice, in taking offence beyond former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and beyond all meaſure acute in aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſes of diſſatisfaction. The old Church-dividers ſwallowed many things, that our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters strain at as fundamental corruptions; and most of the things, which they object as the cauſes of their departure from us, were never known before to have made any difference between Chriſtians. For who, I pray, before our Diſſenters, ſeparated from a Church, for having a ſet Form, and Order of Divine Service? Who before our times ever took offence at the uſe of the Prayer that Chriſt taught his Diſciples? What ſect from
<pb facs="tcp:95441:5"/>
the beginning, forſook the Aſſemblies of the faithful, for uſing the ſign of the Croſs, as the common Enſign of the faith of Chriſt crucified, upon the ſolemn admiſſion of Church-members? Who ever divided the Communion of any Church, becauſe it had a Biſhop? <hi>Aerius</hi> indeed pretended to ſee no difference between a Biſhop and a Presbyter; but this was not the reaſon, but only the effect of his ſeparation: for having no Biſhop of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, he was forced to repreſent them as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, though he durſt not condemn their Inſtitution. It is ſtrange, that theſe blemiſhes ſhould ſo long deform the Church, and no Greek or Latin Sectary have the ſagacity to diſcern them; that ſo palpable motives of ſeparation ſhould eſcape the ſpirit of <hi>Maximilla,</hi> and the acuteneſs of <hi>Tertullian;</hi> that the <hi>Novatians</hi> reputed skillful men in obſerving faults, ſhould be ſo little perſpicacious, as not to diſcover ſuch groſs abominations: Or that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> ſhould puzzle themſelves ſo long, with a ſtory of <hi>Cecilian,</hi> that they could never make out, and leave ſuch Topicks as theſe untouched. I cannot think the people of former ages ſo groſs, as ſome of our <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſi</hi> may repreſent them. From the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they choſe, they reaſoned as well as we, and their Sectaries wanted no wit to find out ſuch objections of Nonconformity, as our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters have advanced. But as I am apt in ſome things to be favourable to Antiquity; ſo
<pb facs="tcp:95441:6"/>
in this caſe, I cannot but commend the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ancient Schiſmaticks, for not uſing ſuch frivolous pretences, as must unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expoſe them to the ſcorn of all diſcerning men, who ſeeing through ſuch miſerable ſhifts, must conclude, that no ingenuous mind could uſe them, and nothing but conſummate and hardened Hypocriſie perſist in them.</p>
            <p>But of all the Pleas preferred by Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> none looks more new, or more affected, than that which concerns <hi>Dioceſan Epiſcopacy.</hi> The old quarrel about the preheminence of Biſhops above Presbyters, ſeems in a manner to be dropped, and all the difficulty now to remain, concerning the bounds of the Biſhops Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and the numbers belonging to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection; yet in ancient times this made no difference.</p>

Soz. l. 7. c. 19.</note> obſerving the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of ancient Dioceſes, and ſome other little uſages, in which the Churches of one Country differed from thoſe of another, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the wiſdom of ancient Biſhops, who looked upon it as a great piece of folly, to
<pb facs="tcp:95441:6"/>
divide communion about theſe matters: The greatneſs or ſmallneſs of a Dioceſe making in their opinion, no difference in the office. The Synod aſſembled at <hi>Antioch,</hi> in their Letter<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Soz l. 3. c. 8.</note> to <hi>Julius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that they do not account themſelves inferiour to him in authority, though their Churches were not ſo great or populous as his; but are far from diſowning him to be of their Order, becauſe his Dioceſe did exceed theirs. And <hi>Jerom</hi>
               <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Hieron. Ep. ad Evagr.</note> declares himſelf freely upon this point, that the greater or leſſer compaſs of a Dioceſe, made no alteration in the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy; but the poor Biſhop of <hi>Eugubium</hi> had the ſame authority and order with that of <hi>Rome.</hi> Yet now it ſeems this difference is become fundamental: And Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> contends, that there is but one ſort of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to be endured, ſuch only, who have the charge of no more than a ſingle Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. This we are told by him, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles intended; this the firſt three or four Ages practiſed; and within that ſpace of time there was no other Epiſcopacy. How well he hath performed this undertaking will appear from this Book, in which I have been ſo far from diſſembling, or paſſing by any Teſtimony that might ſeem material, that I
<pb facs="tcp:95441:7"/>
am afraid to have incurred very juſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for being too minute and punctual in my anſwers, beyond the merit of the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Yet for this <hi>I</hi> may be allowed to uſe the plea of <hi>Apuleius</hi>
               <note n="(d)" place="bottom">Ne videar cuipiam ſi quid ex frivolis praeteriero, id agnoviſſe potius quam contempſiſſe, — quod ſi forte inepta videbor, &amp; oppido fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vola velle defendere, illis debet ea res vitio verti quibus turpe eſt etiam haec objectaſſe, non mihi culpae dari, cui honeſtum erit, etiam haec diluiſſe. <hi>Apul.

               </note> on the like occaſion, that I have taken notice of many frivolous things, leaſt to ſome I might ſeem to decline them as unanſwerable, and not to omit them out of juſt contempt. And if my anſwers to ſome mean and captious remarks, may ſeem ſometimes to taſt of the futility of the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; yet I hope this will be imputed to him, who was not aſhamed to offer ſuch things in evidence, and not to me who was concerned to diſprove them.</p>
            <p>Some may perhaps expect an Apology for delay, that the Book came not out ſooner. But for this, I am not ſolicitous for an excuſe, apprehending rather the contrary fault, that it is come out too ſoon. For I found in the Book I anſwer, ſo many marks of haſte and
<pb facs="tcp:95441:7"/>
precipitation, that I thought my ſelf obliged to take warning; though the deſign of that work ſeems to have taken up a great part of the Author's life. In ſuch variety of facts, ſo remote, and many of them ſo obſcure, there are too many things to be conſidered to admit of haste: And after all the care, and the leiſure one can take, it is neither eaſie nor uſual, in this kind of work, to avoid over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights, and omiſſions of ſome things very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.</p>
            <p>The Author of the Preface may perhaps think himſelf neglected, that he is not thought conſiderable enough to deſerve an anſwer. He promiſed himſelf, it ſeems, that <hi>the Epiſtle Recommendatory ſhould find the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment with the worthy Treatiſe</hi> of Mr. <hi>Clarkſon.</hi> But Diviners are ſometimes diſappointed. For my part I am reſolved to make a difference between the Book and the <hi>Recommendation.</hi> And <hi>I</hi> hope Mr. <hi>Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cey</hi> will ſee ſome reaſon why he ſhould not take it ill. <hi>I</hi> wiſh he had been able to have repreſented the references right: But we must forgive where it is not to be had, and <hi>I</hi> dare ſay the good man did his beſt.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould he be angry with Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> for defending Proteſtant Principles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts, upon the grounds of the
<pb facs="tcp:95441:8"/>
Church of <hi>England?</hi> Why did not he or ſome of his Brethren ſtep out to vindicate Congregational Epiſcopacy, against Father <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> and his three Collegues, who made but four Dioceſes of this whole Kingdom? For God's ſake tell me, who maintained Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples then upon the foundation of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? But the Serpent and the venomous Vermine are ſubtler than the other Beaſts of the field; for in hard weather they are not to be found on the face of the Earth, but are crept into their holes; but when a warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſeaſon comes, they crawl out, to ſnap at the heels of thoſe who had endured the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the winter.</p>
            <p>If he expected the ſame Treatment with Mr. <hi>Clarkſon,</hi> he ſhould have written in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly, and writ ſenſe. But when he runs the Changes upon <hi>Jus Divinum, Humanum,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolicum;</hi> when he talks of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphroditick Divinity,</hi> of <hi>Office-Charge,</hi> of <hi>Office Diſcrimination,</hi> of <hi>Appendix-Courts</hi> and <hi>Veſtments,</hi> and <hi>Canons among the Heteroclites of his Divinity,</hi> what can a man do but wonder and keep ſilence? Believe me, I would as ſoon diſpute with a Paper-mill, as undertake to anſwer a man of ſuch amazing language. But for the <hi>Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roclites, I</hi> may perhaps know what they may import; it is when a thing changes its kind:

            <p>IT is an eaſie matter for thoſe who confine their Charity, as they do their Primitive Epiſcopacy, to a ſingle Congregation, to charge all who differ from them, as Men wholly governed by <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Interest.</hi> The fondneſs they have for their own Conceits, renders them incapable of any Jealouſie of their Truth or Evidence; and if theſe Notions do not receive ſuch Entertainment, as the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Author is perſwaded they deſerve, and Succeſs do not anſwer<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

            <p>It is juſt indeed, that they ſhould bear the reproach of Inſincerity, who refuſe full or competent Evidence, when the Proofs riſe up

But for Men to advance new Notions and Paradoxes, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things at very great Diſtance, of which, the Proofs are obſcure, and the Evidence only conjectural; and then to cry out upon thoſe who are not convinc'd, as Perſons of no Faith or Equity, argues a Confidence very unuſual, and rarely to be ſeen either in underſtanding or good Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That for the ſpace of the firſt three Centuries, a Biſhop was no more than a Paſtor to a ſingle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation;</hi> is in the firſt place, a Concluſion very new, and never heard, that I can learn, before the laſt Age. The ſpace of time inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening between the neareſt point of the <hi>three Centuries</hi> aſſign'd, and the Birth of this Notion wants little of Thirteen compleat Centuries; and therefore the Evidence of a matter ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, ought to be poſitive and direct; and it muſt be expected, that ſome Ancient Witneſſes who liv'd within the compaſs of that Term, or in the next Age at leaſt, ſhould be produced and have declared expreſly, that no Biſhop had more than one ſingle Congregation, or that it was the Opinion of thoſe Times, that a Biſhop ought to have no more: If but one Author of Credit had left this Teſtimony, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Evidence might reaſonably be admitted for Confirmation; but when all the Proof of a Fact ſo diſtant, conſiſts only of Conjectures and Suſpicions, and unconcluding Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; I hope that in this time of Liberty, an honeſt Man may refufe to believe ſo obſcure and unneceſſary Inferences, without any Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95441:11"/>
of his Reputation. It may be very true, that ſome Villages had Biſhops; that ſeveral Cities were not greater than ſome of our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Towns; that all the People may be ſaid in an uſual ſenſe to be preſent at Church in the greateſt Cities; all this may be true, and yet very far from proving the Point in Queſtion.</p>
            <p>The Concluſion, Congregational Epiſcopacy, may remain ſtill at as great a diſtance from theſe Premiſes, as the Primitive Times we ſpeak of are from the preſent Age, or as ſome gifted Mens Diſcourſes are from the Text.</p>
            <p>When this fancy of Primitive Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Epiſcopacy came firſt into Mens heads, the Dioceſan way had been every where Eſtabliſh'd; and that we may not take this for a piece of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, no Churches came nearer to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Standard, than thoſe that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the immediate Juriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> nor was it pretended, that Dioceſan Biſhops were new; they had an acknowledg'd Preſcription of above twelve hundred years; but the time of its riſe was not ſo poſitively aſſign'd. <hi>Cartwright</hi> pretended to trace ſome footſteps of the Congregational way in the two firſt Centuries; but I do not find that he, or the Diſſenters of his Time, had made the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſo univerſal, that no Biſhop within that compaſs of Time, had more than one Congregation. <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the greateſt Cities ſeem'd to ſtand out, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd Exceptions; but now they too are taken in, and reduc'd to the Congregational Model. It is ſomething hard to conceive, how the Species of Church-Government ſhould come to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95441:12"/>
be chang'd, and no Account of ſo important a Change be tranſmitted to Poſterity: Thoſe who fancy Presbytery turn'd into Epiſcopacy in the former part of the ſecond Century, make ſome ſhew of Reply, when they ſay, that it is a very obſcure Age, and hath left little or nothing of its Story behind it. But the Ages in which Primitive Epiſcopacy is pretended to have been transform'd into Dioceſan, were of another Character; they abounded with Learning and Writers, and a great many of their Books have been preſerv'd, but not the leaſt hint of this Fundamental Alteration of Church-Government. What! ſo juſt an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence given by the Church, and no Sectary, no Schiſmatick to reproach her? Thoſe who were ſo minute and trifling in their Cavils, could they overlook ſo obvious a Topick as this of Dioceſan Innovation? Nay, theſe very Sects, where their Numbers made them capable, liv'd themſelves under the Dioceſan Way: If then in times of ſo much Diviſion, Contention and Diſpute, ſuch a change as this could be introduc'd without any Oppoſition, and all Parties of different Opinions and Intereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd to it; for my part, I cannot ſee how it can be denied, that it was done by Miracle: For what greater Miracle can we well imagin, than that ſo many ſorts of Chriſtians divided by Principles and mutual Averſions, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to receive this pretended alteration of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy? So that thoſe who deny it to be Primitive, muſt allow it a higher Title, ſince Miracle carries with it much greater Authority than Preſcription.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95441:12"/>Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> therefore had great reaſon to aprehend, <hi>that it would appear a great Paradox, to hear that a Biſhop of Old was but the Paſtor of a ſingle Church, or that his Dioceſe was no larger than one Communion Table might ſerve.</hi> It does indeed ſeem very ſtrange; not only <hi>to thoſe who take the Meaſures of Ancient times and things by their own, or are much concern'd they ſhould not be otherwiſe than they are now;</hi> but moſt of all to thoſe who have competent knowledg of thoſe Times, and who are qualify'd to make ſome Judgment of the State of the Primitive Church, from the Teſtimonies of Eccleſiaſtical Writers.

            <p>
               <hi>How great Advantages may be expected from a clear diſcovery of,</hi> what the Author thinks to be, <hi>true in this particular,</hi> I cannot readily diſcern, having not the aſſiſtance of his Proſpective to diſcover things at ſo vaſt a diſtance; much leſs can I ſee <hi>that it may contribute much to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of the Controverſies among us about Church-Government, and bringing them to a happy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95441:13"/>
Now to deal liberally with this Notion of Primitive Epiſcopacy, let us yield up the point at once, and grant, that no Biſhop for the three firſt Centuries had more than one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: But at the ſame time, let us take the Reaſon along with us, that for ſo long time, no City had more Chriſtians then might meet in one Church; no Biſhop then could have more Congregations then all the Chriſtians of his City and Territory did compoſe. But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies about Church-Government are ſtill undecided, for this does not preclude the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops from a right of having many Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under their inſpections, if more had been. The Controverſies about Church-Government turn upon queſtions of Right, and not of Fact. But matters of Fact are pertinently alledg'd to prove a Right, where the Fact does involve a Judgment of Right; but where it is purely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, it has no conſequence on either ſide. Two great Caſuiſts upon a certain time fell into Diſpute about the Lawfulneſs of taking Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, the Diſpute was carried on with great Learning and Niceneſs, one made it out clearly, that none of the Primitive Chriſtians ever uſed it, and that for many Centuries there was not one Chriſtian Smoker in the World. The other deſired to know the Principle upon which they condemn'd it, and was told very ſeriouſly, that there were no Church cenſures againſt it, nor could there well be any, for the Plant had not yet been brought to theſe Parts of the World. So the Controverſy remain'd undecided by this negative inſtance of the Primitive Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their forbearance was not the effect of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95441:13"/>
Judgment or Choice, but from an abſolute igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the matter.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>for deciding of Controverſies, and bringing things to a happy compoſure,</hi> I was reſolv'd to ſignalize my Complyance, and ſubmit to a Paradox, not for the ſake of any Teſtimony brought by the Author, but to avoid Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and upon the account of Peace. But ſeeing all our Controverſies about Church-Government remain in the ſame ſtate after all my yeelding, I conceive that I am at liberty to revoke my Conceſſion, and to Conteſt the matter of Fact, and to ſhew that the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies alleg'd by Mr. <hi>Clerkſon,</hi> do not make ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof of the point under debate, <hi>that a Biſhop in the three first Centuries was no more than Pastour to a ſingle Congregation.</hi>

               <hi>For the Scripture-times there will be little difficulty, ſince as much is acknowledged by the moſt Learned and Judicious Aſſertors of Prelacy, as need be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</hi>

               </note> Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whitgift</hi> is brought in to witneſs, that <hi>the Goſpel was not generally receiv'd any where</hi> when it was firſt Preach'd. That <hi>when</hi> Matthias <hi>was choſen, the whole Church was gathered in one place, and ſo it was when the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons were choſen;</hi> this may be true, and yet not reach to the whole extent of Scripture-times, but only to thoſe inſtances of Popular Election, which were alledg'd by <hi>Cartwright,</hi> the lateſt of which ſeems to be within a Year of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Aſcenſion: and if for the firſt Year of the Apoſtles Preaching, the Church might not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe beyond a ſingle Congregation, it will
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95441:14"/>
be of no great conſequence either for or againſt Dioceſan Epiſcopacy: yet it is plain from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that the matter of Fact was otherwiſe. For in the Election of <hi>Matthias,</hi> the Aſſembly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of about <hi>a hundred and twenty;</hi>

               <note n="(c)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</note> ſo that not a fourth part of the Church was preſent at that Election. When the Deacons were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, the whole Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> could not be preſent in that Aſſembly, for the number of the Converts was then too great, eſpecially conſidering the Chriſtians had not the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of very capacious places to meet in. A great part of the Church was not concern'd to be preſent on that occaſion, for the Women had no part in Election, nor perhaps Servants, nor Children tho' of Age, while they liv'd in their Fathers Houſe. But that the whole Church could not be preſent, I ſhall then ſhew more fully, when I conſider the ways by which our Author endeavours to diminiſh the firſt-Fruits of the Goſpel, and to leſſen the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Downham</hi> is alledg'd to as little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: For all he affirms, is, <hi>that at the very first Converſion of Cities, the whole number of People converted was able to make but a ſmall Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For who can tell how far he intended <hi>the very firſt Converſions</hi> ſhould extend? The cloſing of the Scriptures of the New Teſtament was above ſixty Years after the <hi>firſt Converſions</hi> of many great Cities; and therefore, tho' at the firſt Converſions the number of Chriſtians
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95441:14"/>
might be but ſmall, yet a Church may improve ſomething in threeſcore Years, and grow up from one <hi>ſmall,</hi> to many great Congregations. <hi>No inſtance,</hi> ſays our Author, <hi>can be brought againſt this, but the three thouſand Converted at</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

by the order of <hi>Ceſtius Gallus</hi> under <hi>Nero, i. e.</hi> above three hundred and fifty years after. The Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might be much more numerous in the Apoſtles time, than in the Age of <hi>Hecataeus,</hi> and therefore this Calculation cannot be certain, and this Spectre of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration vaniſhes.</p>
            <p>That I may not ſeem to want a due regard for Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi>'s diligence upon this Point, I will not diſmiſs his Calculation with ſo ſhort a Reply, but examine every point of it apart, and ſhew of what conſequence it may be to the preſent Queſtion, concerning Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Epiſcopacy. 1. The three Millions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Nero</hi> came from no authentick <hi>Cenſus,</hi> or any certain account, but only from conjecture; and one may reaſonably ſuſpect, that the Prieſts, to ſet out the greatneſs of the Nation to a Prince who had them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, would be apt to over-reckon. 2. <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> could not receive ſo many Millions, if the circuit of it were but thirty-three fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, as we read in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and our Author does contend it was no more. 3. If this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Prieſts ſhould be admitted, yet that Paſſover might be extraordinary, and like that of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> of which it is ſaid,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">2 Kings 23.22.</note> that <hi>ſurely there was not holden ſuch a Paſſover, from the days of the Judges that judg'd</hi> Iſrael, <hi>nor in all the days of the Kings of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>nor of the Kings of</hi> Judah. And that this Number was extraordinary, appears from <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who accounting for the incredible Number ſaid to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95441:18"/>
be ſlain and taken in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> informs us, that the Jews reſorted thither out of all the Country, and were unawares ſhut up in that fatal Siege; and yet the Sum was about twelve hundred thouſand perſons, not half of that number upon which our Author cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates: Yet this ſeem'd ſo extraordinary,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

Though a middle number might be agreed on for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating the Paſcal Aſſemblies, yet would it be of no uſe in the preſent Queſtion; for we do not read in Scripture of any Converts made on the Paſſover; but the three Thouſand which are now under debate, were converted on the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and from the reſort of the one, no gueſs can be made of the Numbers that repair'd to the other; for the Paſſover was much more frequented than the Pentecoſt. It is true, that the Law ſeems to make no difference between the three Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, but obligeth all the Males to repair to the place which God ſhould chooſe upon each of thoſe Feaſts.

And the words of the Book of <hi>Samuel</hi> do as plainly intimate, that <hi>Elkanah</hi> himſelf, though a <hi>Levite,</hi> went up to <hi>Shilo</hi> but once a year:<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.3, 20, 21.</note>

But however theſe places may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, it is allow'd by all, that the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was the chiefeſt for Solemnity and reſort of Worſhipers, of all the Feaſts of the Jews, and therefore a computation of the Strangers at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on a Pentecoſt, from the extraordinary Numbers ſaid once to have been at a Paſſeover, muſt be very fallacious; for the ſame Calculation cannot ſerve both.</p>

to depart from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in twelve years, we muſt conclude the numbers of Proſelytes muſt needs ſurpaſs the meaſure of a Congregation, if the ſucceſs of following years did in any proportion anſwer this beginning.</p>
            <p>All the endeavours therefore of deduction from the numbers of Converts expreſſed by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> can have no place in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> For, 1. All that were converted on Pentecoſt, are ſaid <hi>to continue in the Apoſtles</hi>

The five thouſand added to theſe, according to the circumſtances of the Story, and the expoſition of all the ancient Writers, will afford no occaſion for any deduction. 3. The increaſe, of which the numbers are not expreſs'd, may reaſonably be preſum'd no way inferior to the other, where the number is ſet down; but if we obſerve the Expreſſions, ſeem to ſurpaſs them. For when five thouſand were converted, it is ſaid, that <hi>many of thoſe who heard the Word, believed.</hi> If the number had not follow'd, this would have paſs'd for a little matter with our Author; but in other places it is ſaid, that <hi>great multitudes both of Men and Women, a great number of Prieſts,</hi> &amp;c. 4.

to give a check to the Rulers, and to reſtrain them from perſecuting the Apoſtles, it cannot be well doubted, but the Apoſtles improv'd this good diſpoſition to a perfect converſion. 5. Beſides the preaching of the Apoſtles, the influence of the Converts, who were generally men, upon their Families, could not fail of having great effect, and of making no ſmall addition to the ſum of Believers.

Biſhops, how ſmall a Dioceſe would the ſhare of each make up?</hi> For this he cites Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on the Rev. c. 11. p. 662. It is true indeed, <hi>D. H.</hi> was of opinion, that the Believers of the Circumciſion did for ſome time keep at ſome diſtance from the Gentile Converts, and had their Aſſemblies and Officers apart; and that the Apoſtles having no other remedy, were obliged to manage the matter ſo tenderly as to connive for ſome time at this ſeparation. But this can by no means concern the caſe of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> within the time of her increaſe, before the death of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> and the converſion of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> for as yet no Gentile had been baptized, <hi>Cornelius</hi> being the firſt, and that ſome time after theſe many thouſands had been converted in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Beſides, were this allow'd, that the Jews and Gentiles in each City had a diſtinct Biſhop, yet that makes nothing for the Congregational way, for this happened upon another Account. And after the ruin of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the deſtruction of the Jewiſh Commonwealth, the Jews came to an accommodation, and joyned with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles under the ſame Officers, before the ſecond Century; and therefore can be of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the point in hand. And if thoſe Dioceſes were ſmall, it was in order to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er increaſe, that the Jews might be for a little while indulg'd, and then united with the Gentiles in one Church. But after all, this matter of ſeparate Churches is no more than the conjecture of ſome learned men; and our Author himſelf is willing to diſmiſs it, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

But one thing I would learn of him, what ſort of Biſhops he takes theſe to be? For if in his opinion they are no other than Presbyters, then this place is impertinently alledg'd, ſince many Presbyters are by all ſides acknowledg'd to have belong'd to one Church. But if he ſpeak of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in the common Eccleſiaſtical ſence, and then concludes from this paſſage, that there were many in the Church of <hi>Philippi;</hi> his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is as ſingular, as that of the Doctor he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to refute. For my part, I muſt profeſs that I am not much concern'd in this Diſpute between our Author and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> about theſe Biſhops. I could never find ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe them any other than Presbyters, as the generality of Fathers and of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our own Church have done. And tho' I have great reverence for the name and memory of Dr. <hi>Hammond;</hi> yet where he is alone, I may

without any imputation of diſreſpect, take the common liberty of leaving his opinion to ſtand or fall according to the ſtrength of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon which it is founded. Yet there are ſome things in our Authors reply, which may be taken notice of.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Nor will I contend with our Author about the other Argument of Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> which he rejects; that <hi>Philippi</hi> was a Metropolis, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a <hi>Colonie.</hi> It does not indeed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow; but yet <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies were generally placed in the principal Cities of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and endow'd with the chief Dignities and Juriſdictions in the Countries where they were. So <hi>Carthage, Corinth, Caeſarea,</hi> and many others might be nam'd. But if it was the <hi>Head</hi> of that part of the Country and a <hi>Colony,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi>'s old Copy has it, this Diſpute is over; and nothing I am ſure Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> has produc'd, does make out that it was not a <hi>Metropolis</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was there.</p>
            <p>Now this Debate concerning the Biſhops of <hi>Philippi</hi> had ſoon been at an end; if our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had thought fit to explain himſelf, and told us what he meant by Biſhops. For were they Paſtors of ſingle elect Congregations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively in covenant? Then there muſt have been ſeveral Churches or Congregations in that one City. But on other occaſions he will not allow more than one Congregation for three hundred years after Chriſt, even in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. But if we allow ſuch an obſcure place as <hi>Philippi</hi> to have many Churches ſo early; we cannot avoid yielding to <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> and other great Cities many more; and what will prove worſe than all, thoſe Churches muſt be acknowledg'd to be all under one Biſhop. Or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95441:26"/>
were theſe Biſhops only Presbyters ruling the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi> with common and equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? Then our Author muſt give up the Queſtion, and inſtead of making many Biſhops muſt own that there was none at all there but only Presbyters. Will he contend that there were no other Biſhops than Presbyters? This will be to abuſe his Reader with the ambiguity of a word, which he takes in one ſenſe and the Church in another. That many Presbyters might belong to one Congregation, none ever deny'd; that many Biſhops in the allow'd and eccleſiaſtical ſenſe of the word had the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of one City, ſounds ſtrange and incredible to the ancient Chriſtians. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerving this expreſſion <hi>of the Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Philippi,</hi> ſeems to be ſtartled with it. <hi>What, many Biſhops in one City? By no means, it cannot be. What then? They were not Biſhops properly ſo call'd, but Preſbyters.</hi>

But if we demand here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, what Biſhops are here meant, whether theſe were Biſhops in the ſenſe of the preſent queſtion, or Presbyters only? The objection vaniſhes, and leaves the Reader to wonder, that any man ſhould ſo ſolemnly undertake to prove
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95441:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what no man ever doubted, that in Scripture-times there were many Presbyters over one Church. But Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> will have theſe Biſhops to be Suffragans of <hi>Epheſus:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> with all his force does endeavour to diſprove them to have been City Biſhops. Now in the midſt of this contention, we may be very ſafe from the danger of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Epiſcopacy. For if Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s way prevail, theſe Biſhops muſt have each a City and Territory, and be Dioceſans either actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, or in right. If Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> carries it, then properly ſpeaking there might not be a Biſhop among them all; for they are but Presbyters belonging, not to ſeveral Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Congregations, but to one Church, and might have a Biſhop to whom they were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as the Ancients believ'd they had, and thought <hi>Timothy</hi> to be the Perſon. And here he muſters up great forces againſt Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s opinion, and affirms,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Pr. Ep. p. <hi>10, 11.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>the Text it ſelf, the Syriack Verſion, Chryſoſtom, Theophilact, Oecumenius</hi> and <hi>Theodoret, and the whole ſtream of Ancients are against this new ſenſe, not any favoring it but one among them all.</hi> But what ſenſe are theſe Ancients for? that there were many Biſhops of one City-Church?

And our Author's ſtream of <hi>Ancients</hi> are againſt him, who underſtand theſe not to be proper Biſhops, but Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>I ſhould diſmiſs this point about the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Biſhops; if our Author did not ſay <hi>he did inſist</hi> upon another Argument, as new and altogether his own. The ſum of it is this. <hi>The Apostle</hi> Paul <hi>reſolv'd to be at</hi> Jeruſalem<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Acts 20.16.</note> 
               <hi>at the day of Pentecost.—But he could not be there at the day, if he ſtay'd long at</hi> Miletus. <hi>And he could not Aſſemble the Biſhops of</hi> Aſia <hi>there, if he stay'd not long there.</hi> Epheſus <hi>was fifty miles from</hi> Miletus, <hi>and ſo four days journey going and coming. And if</hi> Paul <hi>ſtay'd longer than three or four days at the most at</hi> Miletus, <hi>he could not be at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>at Pentecost.</hi> Now <hi>the chief Cities of</hi> Aſia he ſhews were at <hi>a great diſtance from</hi> Epheſus, and at a greater from <hi>Miletus: and therefore the Elders ſent for, could not be thoſe of the ſeveral Cities of</hi> Aſia, <hi>but of</hi> Epheſus; <hi>and then it cannot be deny'd, but in that Church there was a plurality of Elders or Biſhops.</hi> That there was there a plurality of

into the leſſer and ſubordinate Churches, we now call</hi> Pariſhes, <hi>and Presbyters aſſign'd to them, they had not only one Altar in one Church or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum, but one Altar to a Church, taking Church for the Company or Corporation of the Faithful u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited under one Biſhop; and that was in the City and place where the Biſhop had his reſidence.

Yet that I may not ſeem to decline an Anſwer in this place; I will give the ſum of what is there anſwer'd, and add ſomething for future explication. Firſt then, Altar in the primitive ſenſe, ſignify'd not only the Communion Table, but the whole place where the Chair of the Biſhop and the Seats of the Presbyters were plac'd; and in this ſenſe there was but one Altar in one Dioceſe, as there is now but one Conſiſtory. This is explain'd by paſſages out of <hi>Ignatius, Cyprian,</hi> and Arch-Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher;</hi> and to be <hi>within the Altar,</hi> which is <hi>Ignatius</hi> his phraſe, is no other than to be in Communion with the Biſhop and his Clergy. And the <hi>one Altar</hi> is no more than one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which may be held in different places, and at ſeveral Tables. Beſides ſome paſſages cited out of <hi>Ignatius</hi> about <hi>one Altar,</hi> are only
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95441:30"/>
alluſive to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Temple and Altar, and therefore are not to be urg'd too ſtrictly. Laſtly, the name of Altar might be appropriated to that of the Biſhop's Church upon another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and that is in reſpect of the oblations of the Faithful, which were preſented there only, and from thence diſtribution was made according to the occaſions of the Church. Among other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, was the Bread and the Wine which were to ſerve for the Sacrament; theſe were always bleſs'd at the Biſhops Altar, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conſecrated there. Concerning theſe oblations preparatory to the Sacrament Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has given a judicious account in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Sacrifice, where he ſhews theſe Offerings were in the nature of a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and upon the account of theſe gifts, the Table might receive its name of Altar. For as the <hi>Jews</hi> had but one Altar, on which their Sacrifices were offer'd and ſanctify'd, yet were they eaten at ſeveral Tables; ſo the Biſhops Altar might ſerve to the ſame purpoſe, at leaſt within the ſame City, to receive thoſe Oblations which were to be communicated in different places. This was the practice of <hi>Rome</hi> in Pope <hi>Innocent</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Innoc.</hi> Ep. ad Decent.</note> the firſt his time, who <hi>ſent the Bread allready conſecrated to all the Churches of the City;</hi> but did not ſend any <hi>to ſuch Presbyters as were plac'd in</hi> remote <hi>Cemiteries, ſince they might conſecrate themſelvs;</hi> and as for Country Pariſhes he did not think it convenient the Holy Conſecrated Bread ſhould be ſent to

them, for it was not fit it ſhould be carry'd to places remote. So all, though not preſent in the ſame place, did yet partake of one Altar, and eat of the ſame Spiritual Bread. And to this purpoſe perhaps, may moſt commodiouſly be underſtood that noted paſſage of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> concerning the adminiſtration of the Euchariſt in Chriſtian Aſſemblies, where he ſays, that <hi>the Deacons distribute it to all that are preſent, and carry it to thoſe who are not preſent.</hi> For to all who were not preſent, as they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd in their ſeveral dwellings, it could not conveniently be carry'd by the Deacons; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that in numerous Congregations it was not eaſy to know who was not preſent.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95441:31"/>
was very bad, to make ſo many Converts, and to erect ſo many Titles in the year three hundred and five, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors were perſecuting the Chriſtians to utter extirpation, and when there was not a Church or Title ſtanding in <hi>Rome.</hi> This was the third year of the Perſecution, according to<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Baluz.

So that the relation being fabulous, and forg'd by one who had no knowledg of thoſe times, the inferences made from it muſt drop.</p>
            <p>It was ſurely, not very well contriv'd to multiply Churches for Baptiſm, and to leave but one Communion Table for all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of <hi>Rome.</hi> For one Baptiſtry may ſerve the greateſt City, becauſe men are baptiz'd but once, and that not all together, but at ſeveral times; and in ancient times no City had more, unleſs where the magnificence of Emperors or Biſhops made, as it were, many Cathedrals. And at this time in the City of <hi>Florence,</hi>

But the uſe of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95441:32"/>
Altar was more general and more conſtant; for every Lord's day, in the primitive times, all the Faithful receiv'd the Sacrament. And the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it does require more time and more room than any other office of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion. For more may pray together, or hear the Scriptures or a Sermon with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, than can receive the Sacrament, which was delivered<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Euſ. H.

            <p>To conclude, the words of the counterfeit <hi>Damaſus</hi> now under debate, do not deny to thoſe Pariſh-Churches the adminiſtration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; for when he appoints them for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and Penance; he doth not exclude all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian Offices, ſuch as Prayer, reading of the Scripture, or the Communion; but names thoſe of Baptiſm and Penance, becauſe even in his time they were not allow'd to every Pariſh-Church.

In ſmaller and leſſe populous Towns there was but one Church, in which all were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together, ſuch as the Cities of Cyprus were, upon which account</hi> Epiphanius <hi>obſerves the manner of</hi> Alexandria <hi>as an unuſual thing, and ſtrange to his People.</hi> This is what <hi>Petavius</hi> delivers there. <hi>You may gueſs,</hi> ſays he, as our Author fancies, <hi>that this was peculiar to</hi> Alexandria,—<hi>but the ſame thing was ordered elſewhere, and he did not doubt but it was ſo in all the greater Cities.</hi> But that <hi>Petavius</hi> ſhould prove this alſo by the Council of <hi>Neocaeſarea, can.</hi> 13. is an overſight yet ſtranger. For though <hi>Petavius</hi> cites that Canon, yet it is not to prove this or any thing like it; but having entred into a diſcourſe about <hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> he ſhews from that Canon, that they were Biſhops and not Presbyters; becauſe they had the priviledge of officiating in the City-Church, in the preſence of the Biſhop or his Presbyters, whereas that priviledge is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly deny'd the Country-Presbyters. But how our Author came to fancy this paſſage to be

Before the Conqueſt this Country<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Malmſ. l. <hi>3.</hi> vil. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> had ſeveral Biſhops ſeated in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95441:39"/>
Villages, who were afterwards tranſlated to Cities, but they were no leſs Dioceſans before, than after their tranſlations. And at this time in <hi>Wales</hi> there are four Biſhops who are content with Villages for their Sees, and yet have large Dioceſes to govern. Of old the <hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> who ſeem to have been rather Presbyters than Biſhops, had their reſidence in Villages; but each of them had many Villages under his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. What hurt then can theſe inſtances of Biſhops in Villages do to the Dioceſan way? Or why are they repreſented ſo formidable to Epiſcopal Writers, that <hi>they will not endure to hear of them?</hi> Had every Village that might furniſh a Congregation, a Biſhop reſiding it it? Or thoſe Biſhops who were Seated in Villages, were they only Pariſh-Paſtors, and confin'd within the bounds of their reſpective Villages? If our Author had prov'd this, there had been ſome ground to ſet Village-Biſhops againſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan; but ſince he has not thought fit to do this, I may take leave to ſay that he has left his Argument imperfect, and far ſhort of the purpoſe for which it is produced.</p>
               <p>To make this general Anſwer yet more plain, let us ſuppoſe the bounds of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes to become as much unknown to after-ages, as thoſe of the old <hi>Egyptian</hi> or <hi>Syrian</hi> Dioceſes are now to us; and that the Books of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clerkſon,</hi> and others, againſt Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Biſhops in this Country ſhould be loſt, for the Genius does not promiſe immortality. Under this ſuppos'd ignorance of the preſent diſtribution of our Biſhopricks, if a dabler in antiquity finding that St. <hi>Davids, Landaf,</hi> and St.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95441:39"/>
                  <hi>Aſaph</hi> had been Biſhops ſeats ſome ages before; and that in elder times, <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and <hi>Selſea,</hi> and <hi>Kirton,</hi> and <hi>Elmham,</hi> and <hi>Hexham,</hi> and ſome other Villages in <hi>England</hi> had been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with Epiſcopal Chairs, ſhould upon this diſcovery entertain a conceit, that our Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy was parochial, and that a Biſhop in our time and many ages before us was no more than a Pariſh-Miniſter, and write a Book to maintain this vainfancy: Such an undertaking, and ſuch a work would be the exact copy of this Chapter of Village-Biſhops.</p>
               <p>It may perhaps ſeem a needleſs labour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the inſtances he has collected of Villages that were Epiſcopal ſeats, ſince they reach not the point in queſtion, nor make the leaſt colour of proof that the Biſhops reſiding in Villages were but Paſtors of a ſingle Congregation. But ſince he pleaſed himſelf ſo much with this performance, that he ſeems to triumph, and ſay, That the inſtances <hi>of Biſhops in Villages were more than ſome are willing to take notice of,</hi> he has laid a ſort of a neceſſity upon his Anſwerer not to paſs them by, leſt his Diſciples might miſtake a juſt neglect of impertinence, for a deſpair or diffidence of being able to reply. I will therefore <hi>take notice of every inſtance</hi> he has produc'd upon this head, tho' I may have juſt reaſon to apprehend the cenſure or contempt of my Readers for inſiſting ſo minutely upon the examination of things, which to the firſt view ſufficiently appear to be beſide the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

A happy place, where primitive Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy began about four hundred years after Chriſt, when from the days of St. <hi>Mark</hi> to that time, it had lain under the yoke of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Uſurpation.</p>
               <p>Having travell'd through <hi>Egypt,</hi> not with the uſual curioſity to ſee great Cities and Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids, but with an humble inquiſitiveneſs to look for Villages, and the obſcureſt places that had been the ſeats of Biſhops; let us now ſit down and recollect what we have obſerv'd. We have found after great ſearch, that two Villages in <hi>Lybia,</hi> where Cities are not very frequent, once in diſtracted times had a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, though they had been Pariſhes belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Erythros</hi> for near four hundred years after Chriſt. One Village we find had a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of two Biſhops, but the circumſtances of the place or people are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. Another Village we obſerv'd in <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> that gave name to a people, and had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable territory. Four Cities we miſtook for Villages, not becauſe they were ſmall, but for want of skill. One Village wanted
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95441:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nothing of a City but the name, and to make amends for this defect, a large Country was joyn'd to it. One was made a Biſhops ſeat for private ends, about the beginning of the fifth Century, having never been ſo before, and being then very uſeful for it. And in the laſt place there was <hi>Iſchyras</hi> his Village, rais'd to a Biſhop's ſeat by the <hi>Arians,</hi> the leaſt of all indeed, and yet much greater than the merit of the Biſhop.</p>
               <p>I may be thought perhaps to deal too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly with my Adverſary; if I ſhould not allow more Epiſcopal Villages to have been in <hi>Egypt</hi> in old time, than he is able to find at this diſtance; therefore I am content to grant where he cannot prove, and to take his general obſervation to ſupply the defect of particular Evidence; that<note n="(i)" place="bottom">

But that Hiſtorian ſhewing the different traditions and practice of ſeveral Nations, obſerves, that the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> though they had many Cities, yet had but one Biſhop. In <hi>other Nations,</hi> as in <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> there were Biſhops in Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, ſetting one unuſual practice againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and intimating, that he knew of no other Countries where they had Village-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; and therefore having no other Inſtances in the Catholick Church, he takes notice of the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> and <hi>Novatians,</hi> who in <hi>Phrygia</hi> had Biſhops in Villages. So that from this paſſage we ought rather to conclude, that it was not uſual in other Countries, beſides thoſe ſpecified in this paſſage, to have Village-Biſhops; at leaſt-wiſe, that <hi>Sozomen</hi> knew no other, or did not remember any when he wrote that paſſage.

This Roman Province, of which our Author has taken upon him to ſpeak, without underſtanding the matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts now of ſuch Churches as were under the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s immediate Juriſdiction, a great part of which were in the Country that lay next to <hi>Rome;</hi> but many are remote, and ſituated in other Provinces. Now theſe Churches our Author obſerves are now few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than anciently. If he ſpeaks of all thoſe under the peculiar Juriſdiction of the Pope, it is a miſtake; for they are now more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than heretofore. But if he mean only thoſe Biſhopricks that lie near <hi>Rome,</hi> in the next adjoyning Provinces, of thoſe there are fewer indeed belonging to the Pope, than did formerly; not becauſe the Biſhopricks were ſunk, but many of them were made Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhopricks, and others thrown under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florence,</hi> which was in the old Roman Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, was made<note n="(o)" place="bottom">

So that in the two ages next preceding this, within the Roman Province there were ten new Biſhopricks made, and fifteen taken from the immediate Juriſdiction of the Pope, and ſubjected to new Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks. So that the Biſhopricks remain, tho' they are not in the ſame Province. There were indeed about five old Biſhopricks uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to others in the Roman Province ſince the writing of the old Provincial; but we have ſeen ten new rais'd to make amends; and there are more yet unaccounted for, if there were occaſion.</p>
               <p>But after all it ſignifies little to the preſent queſtion, whether the Roman Province at this time have fewer Biſhops, than it had when that old Provincial was made. For that which our Author calls old, is indeed but new in reſpect of Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity. <hi>Baronius</hi> places it in the eleventh Century, and that is <note n="(q)" place="bottom">Ughell.

In this all the printed Copies, and ſix Manuſcripts of the <hi>Lambeth</hi> and <hi>Cotton</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary do agree. But for later Biſhopricks there is a difference between the Copies, the later receiving theſe into the liſt, which in the other are not to be found. The firſt printed Copy came<note n="(u)" place="bottom">Labbe Geogr. eccl. in fine Concil.</note> out in 1503. and that had a mixture of new and old Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks. <hi>Miraeus</hi> pretended to publish the old Provincial more exactly; but either his Copy was not very old, or he did not publish it as he found it; for his Edition has many Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks of the thirteenth and fourteenth Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For in that, among the Bishopricks of the Roman Province <hi>Aquila</hi> is repreſented as united to <hi>Furconium;</hi> whereas <hi>Aquila</hi> was<note n="(x)" place="bottom">Ughell. Ital. Sac.

it was before in the Dioceſe of <hi>Furconium.

And <hi>Mons Caſſini</hi> erected in the year 1322, is exhibited in the ſame Edition. Now <hi>Miraeus</hi>

Nor did he print any one Copy, but jumble ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of different ages together. So that in the Catalogue which he calls old, you have ſeveral Biſhopricks that never ſubſiſted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for he has <hi>Auxima</hi> in the Roman Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and at ſome diſtance after there is <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana.</hi> Whereas<note n="(z)" place="bottom">Ughell.

               <p>Now to return to our Author's obſervation, that there are more Biſhopricks in the Roman Province, in the old Provincial, than in the new; we have ſhewn the contrary, if we take that Province for the extent of a Country repreſented in the old Provincial. For there are above twenty more in the new; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95441:78"/>
of them have left their old relation, and are now under other Metropolitans; and many more have been new erected, than have been ſunk. But ſince the oldeſt of theſe Provincials is no older than the twelfth Century; it will ſignifie little to the point our Author had undertaken to prove, if it ſhould be granted that the Biſhopricks of the Roman Province were once more numerous than they are now. For the ſtate of the <hi>Italian</hi> Dioceſes about the year 1200. will afford but a poor argument for the extent of the primitive Biſhopricks of that Country. The face of Eccleſiaſtical affairs here in the firſt three or ſix hundred years after Chriſt, might be very different from what it was at the end of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Centuries; and in particular, the Roman Province could not but receive a great change from the civil Revolutions of that Country. Now he who from the ſtate of the <hi>Italian</hi> Churches five hundred years ago, will preſume to repreſent Primitive Order and Apoſtolical Inſtitutions, will quickly fall into miſtakes, not only very abſurd, but danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Reformation. The Papiſts would gladly venture all their Controverſies upon this iſſue; and there would remain but little of Popery that, would not be found primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, if the eleventh and twelfth Centuries might preſcribe, and the practice of thoſe ages be received as evidence of immemorial Cuſtom.</p>
               <p>Our Author<note n="(b)" place="bottom">

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95441:78"/>
for <hi>Italy, I cannot diſcover that there are more Biſhops from there than of old. — And in all the new Erections that I can find, diſcounting thoſe which are upon old foundations, amount not to the number of thoſe which are either diſſolv'd or united.</hi> It is not eaſie to diſcover ſuch matters as theſe without ſearch, which he did not think fit to make; for if he had pleas'd to examine, he could not but have found, that the Biſhopricks of <hi>Italy</hi> are much more numerous now, than they were four or five ages ago. In the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> where the Dioceſes are many and little, we may find this by comparing their preſent number with what they had in forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ages. There are now<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Pierre d' Avity. Royaume de Naples. Luc. de Londa, p. 542. Annot. all. Iſtor. de Napole.</note> in that Kingdom 20 Arch-Biſhopricks and 127 Biſhops, though within half an age before they had not ſo many; as may appear from the account of <hi>Thomaſo Coſto,</hi> and <hi>Miraeus</hi> out of <hi>Marinus Freccia;</hi> and <hi>Proſper Auguſtinus</hi> reckons of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Biſhops but 134. But if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the preſent number with what the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the Provincial repreſent, we ſhall find yet greater difference; of theſe the later have the greateſt number, and the older they are, the fewer Dioceſes they have. The lateſt I have ſeen, which was writ in <hi>Clemens</hi> the ſixth"s time, who was made Pope <hi>Anno</hi> 1342. has no more <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Biſhopricks and Arch-Biſhopricks, than 132. In an old Manuſcript of the <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> Library, there are in that Kingdom but
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95441:79"/>
123 Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops. In another, which is the oldeſt I have ſeen, there are but 116. So that within the compaſs of four or five hundred years, above thirty new Sees have been raiſed in that Kingdom. The <hi>Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or <hi>

               <p>As to the ſmall Dioceſes of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> they are ſo far from being Primitive, that moſt of them were erected ſince the tenth Century. <hi>Campana</hi> a ſmall Town, has no Dioceſe beyond the walls; yet was it not made a Biſhoprick till<note n="(d)" place="bottom">vghell.

And the ſmall Biſhopricks that belong to <hi>Beneventum,</hi> were not made till that was rais'd to an Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick, which was in the tenth Century.

               <p>To conclude, the ancient Dioceſes of <hi>Italy</hi> were large, and not half ſo numerous as they are now. For they have been increaſing every age ſince the writing of the Provincial; and even then they were exceedingly multiplied beyond what they had been in the firſt ſix or ſeven Centuries. There are now in <hi>Italy</hi> 31 Arch-Biſhops, and 281 Biſhops, which makes up 312. Now if we look back but two ages, we ſhall find the number much leſs; for in <hi>Bion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di</hi>'s time who died in the year 1463, there were but 264 Cities or Epiſcopal ſeats in all <hi>Italy.</hi> And <hi>Leandro Alberti</hi>

So much is the number of the <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhopricks increaſed within five hundred years.</p>
               <p>But if we go a little back, we ſhall find yet fewer Biſhopricks in <hi>Italy.</hi> For in the <hi>Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> publiſh'd by Dr. <hi>Beveridge</hi>

A general Synod<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Anaſtaſ. in Symmach.</note> of <hi>Italy</hi> under the ſame Pope had 115 Biſhops, which is the only Synod beſides that mentioned above, that the Writer of his life takes notice of under that Pope;<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Syn.

It was this confirm'd <hi>Symmachus</hi> his Election, and condemn'd his Competitor and his Guardians; and the occaſion being extraordinary, it cannot be doubted, but the greateſt part<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Totius fere Italiae Epiſcopi, Ennod.

the peace of the Church.

Therefore to prevent ſuch miſtakes, I will briefly lay down the ſtate of the Churches of <hi>Spain,</hi> from which our Author has produc'd ſome inſtances, from the oldeſt Records that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main of them. In the Year 569. King <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domir</hi> complains<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Conc. Luc. Not. Garc. Loyaſae.</note> that in the Province of <hi>Gallicia</hi> the Dioceſes were ſo large that their Biſhops were not able to viſit them in a Year, and therefore deſires that they would take ſome order to remedy it. Whereupon they erected ſeveral new Biſhopricks, and one new Metropolis; yet all the Biſhopricks of that great Province after this acceſſion, were but thirteen. When the Biſhops of all <hi>Spain</hi> met in the Synod of <hi>Valentia</hi>

                     <hi>Anno. 541.</hi> Luitpr. Adverſ. cum Epiſcopi totius Hiſpaniae conveniſſent.</note> they were in all but ſixty four. In the old Book of <hi>Sevil</hi> there are but 6 Arch-biſhops, and 67 Biſhops in all the Kingdom of <hi>Spain.</hi> In the old Book of <hi>Oviedo</hi> there are but 76 Biſhops. Under King <hi>Wamba,</hi>
                  <note n="(e)" place="bottom">Anno. 666.</note> according to the old Bood call'd <hi>Itacius,</hi> of which <hi>Luitprandus</hi> makes frequent mention, there were in <hi>Spain</hi> 71 Biſhops, and 7 Metropolitans. In a Controverſy between the Arch-biſhops of <hi>Toledo</hi> and <hi>Valentia,</hi> it is ſaid that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had divided the Country into Provinces and Dioceſes, much to the ſame effect with what has been already produc'd; with this agrees the obſervations of <hi>Luitpran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> which are taken from the ſame Books: For ſpeaking of the 13th Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:95441:89"/>
he ſaith the number of the Biſhops there were 76, of whom 27 ſubſcrib'd by Proxies. And in his <hi>Chronicon</hi> he gives notice of ſeveral new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks erected in <hi>Spain,</hi> in the later end of the ſeventh Century. The Dioceſes of <hi>Spain</hi> muſt be very large then, when ſo great a Country was divided between 70 or 80 Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and eſpecially conſidering the Province of <hi>Narbon</hi> was then reckon'd to <hi>Spain.</hi> At the time of the Council of <hi>Illiberis, Spain</hi> ſeems to have but few Biſhops.

For whether the <hi>Franks</hi> by this time had taken another way, and the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Churches
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95441:90"/>
were under great calamities, or <hi>Auguſtin</hi> the Monk had introduc'd the <hi>Roman</hi> cuſtoms, there are but few Biſhops in the ſecond order. But ſuppoſing theſe holy Biſhops had been all of <hi>Ireland;</hi> yet there is no need of ſo many Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals for them; for they laſted four Reigns, which makes up a hundred years. And though all the Biſhops ſeats in <hi>Ireland</hi> had not been above fifty, they might eaſily have afforded 350 Saints in the compaſs of a hundred years. But becauſe there are but ſixty years allow'd for St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Government in <hi>Ireland,</hi> even in that and the ſurviving generation; this number of Biſhops might eaſily riſe from fifty. I mention this number, becauſe ſometimes <hi>Ireland</hi> has had ſo many Dioceſes or more, as we may ſee in a copy of the Provincial publiſh'd by<note n="(q)" place="bottom">Geogr.

But I know not how, a ſudden fancy tranſports our Author to <hi>Afric,</hi> and thither I muſt follow, a proper place to look rarities and unuſual ſights. It cannot indeed be denied, that in this Country there were Biſhops, if not in Villages, yet in <hi>Municipia</hi> or Burrough-Towns; but that this was the primitive ſtate of that Church, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow. And the multiplying of Biſhops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſioned there by the Schiſm of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists,</hi> cannot be alledged for a precedent; ſince the Biſhops of that time complained of it in the Conference of <hi>Carthage,</hi> as a wrong and an innovation. But of this there is a more particular account in another Book,<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Vind. of Prim. ch. p. 516.</note> which I am not willing to tranſcribe.

And yet in another Book he reckons<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Centum ferme Epiſcopi contr. Don. poſt Coll. c. 24.</note> not the Abſents full a hundred, which in his Abſtract he ſets at 120. And for the <hi>Donatists</hi> who are reckon'd 400, we are not ſo eaſily to admit their account. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> never admitted it, though our Author ſays he did not deny they were 400. It is true, he does not poſitively deny it, becauſe he could not be certain of their number; but he does every where ſuggeſt that they boaſted without reaſon, and made themſelves more numerous than they were. For when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have many abſent, and more than the Catholicks, he turns the pretence into a jeſt. <hi>What,</hi> ſays he,<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Aug. poſt Coll. c. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>had ſome Pestilence invaded them, that a third part of their number ſhould be ſick together?</hi> For they had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that they were all preſent, excepting ſuch whom age or ſickneſs had detained. And in all his accounts of the Conference he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects their frauds in ſubſcribing for the abſents, as if they had made their appearance. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſubſcriptions there was one found who had been ſome time dead; and they could not deny it. But be the number of thoſe Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks what they will, it is not reaſonable to admit them into the liſt of the Biſhops of that Country, ſince they ſet up Altar againſt Altar oftentimes in the ſame City, and generally in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95441:93"/>
the ſame Dioceſe, where a Catholick Biſhop was plac'd, and ſometimes ſet up three or four a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one. So there is no reaſon that theſe ſhould ſwell the account of <hi>African</hi> Biſhops. We reckon a Pariſh with us to have but one Rector, though an Independent or Anabaptiſt Teacher may ſet up in it a ſeparate Aſſembly; or though a ſpeaking Presbyterian Elder, the moſt forward and fierceſt of all our Church-dividers, ſhould hold a Conventicle there for a Nurſery to other Sects.</p>
               <p>But <hi>we have reaſon</hi> (our Author thinks) <hi>to take the Donatiſts into the account; ſince the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks decreed, that when the Donatiſts were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, thoſe places among them which had Biſhops ſhould continue to be Epiſcopal ſeats.</hi> If he had thought fit to conſider the order of time, and how different the ſtate of the <hi>African</hi> Church before the Conference at <hi>Carthage</hi> was, from that which followed it; this apparition of an Argument had vaniſhed. Before <hi>Marcellinus</hi> his Decree, the Catholicks of <hi>Africk</hi> made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral temporary Proviſions for the reclaiming of the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> And that no encouragements might be wanting to invite either the People or their Biſhops to be reconciled to the Church; ſometimes they order, that if a Donatiſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſhould prevail with his people to leave their ſchiſm, he ſhould remain ſtill their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: Sometime, that the People who had a Biſhop heretofore, and were converted from the Donatiſts, might without a new order from a Synod, chuſe a Biſhop of their own; or if they would chuſe rather to be annexed to ſome other Dioceſe, it was not to be denied them.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95441:93"/>
Another time it is ordered, that where a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe was divided between a Catholick Biſhop and a Donatiſt, and the later with his people returned to Catholick Communion,<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Aug.

The Donatiſts therefore are not to come into the number of the <hi>African</hi> Biſhops by vertue of that Canon; for at the end of the Canon it ſelf the Imperial Law was afterwards added, as an advertiſement of its being repeal'd. The Canon then was made before the Conference, and conſequently before the computation of S. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> But after the Conference and the Law, the door was ſhut; and the Donatiſt Biſhopricks if they had been parts of others were reſtored to them, and no proviſion made for the Biſhops though they ſhould happen to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95441:94"/>
be converted. After the time of S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> we do not find the <hi>African</hi> Biſhopricks much increaſed. For within fifty years of the death of that Biſhop, we have an account<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Not. Afr. apd. Sirm.

But not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt much upon ſmall matters and uncertain, let us calculate the Biſhopricks of ſuch Provinces of <hi>Africk</hi> of which we have a more diſtinct account.

Now both theſe Provinces, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Pliny,</hi> are 839 miles long, and 480 broad. The Country muſt ſurely be very ill peopled; if every ſorry Village had a Biſhop, nay if every Biſhop had not 60, or 70 Villages in his Dioceſe. Nay, if we conſider the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the whole Roman <hi>Africk,</hi> we ſhall have little reaſon to conclude, that Congregational Epiſcopacy ſhould follow from the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Biſhops in that Country. <hi>Procopius</hi>

Now in this Country ſo vaſt and ſo populous, let us take a low eſtimate of the number of Villages that might be there, and reckon them at forty thouſand; and theſe divided into 500 Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes, every Dioceſe will have fourſcore Towns That this may not ſeem an extravagant Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, let us compare it with other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. <hi>France</hi> is not half ſo big as the Roman <hi>Africk;</hi> and yet in <hi>Lewis</hi> 13 his time it had above two and thirty thouſand Pariſhes, as <hi>Bertius</hi> reckons: And in <hi>Henry</hi> the third's time, by a Tax laid on every Pariſh, they were found<note n="(p)" place="bottom">Bodin. de Rep.</note> to be near five and twenty thouſand; the Provinces of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Poictou</hi> not reckoned, which may make up the remainder. Now it is well known, that there, as well as here, there are many more Villages than Pariſhes; and therefore I conceive I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not over-reckon them, when I ſet a Country for extent double to <hi>France;</hi> and of which a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95441:95"/>
great part was more populous, at almoſt an equal number for Villages: But ſuppoſe the number yet leſs by one half, every Biſhoprick will have forty Villages, which is too much yet for the Congregational way; eſpecially ſince upon this reckoning, Towns muſt be thin and at greater diſtance, and ſo leſs fitted for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Communion with their Biſhop. Nay, though they had at laſt been reduced by the Iniquity of times and the Oppoſition of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the meaſure of our Pariſhes; yet the condition of thoſe Churches would move our pity, rather than our deſire of imitation and condition ſo different from all other Countries, and ſo unlike that of <hi>Africk</hi> it ſelf, when <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> lived. For all the <hi>African</hi> Biſhops of his time could not have ſupplied the Dioceſes of one Province, at the time of which we are ſpeaking. But for all this, when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> or Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> will have it ſo, what is laſt muſt be primitive; what ſprung from the unfortunate diviſions of one Country muſt be a Precedent to all. And that muſt be received as Apoſtolick practice, which was introduced by one of the moſt heady and deſperate and Hypocritical Sects that ever divided the Church of Chriſt. But I am afraid we may ſay with too much truth, that our Country has out-done <hi>Africk</hi> in Monſters of this nature. Yet after all this diſtraction, there remain'd in <hi>Africk</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral large Dioceſes; which has been fully proved in other Books,<note n="(q)" place="bottom">Unreaſonabl of Separ. 249, 250. and Sequ.

               <p>In the end of this Chapter our Author thinks fit to engage Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> who anſwering an Objection concerning <hi>Aſclepius,</hi>
                  <note n="(r)" place="bottom">Gennad. Catal. Script.</note> Biſhop of a ſmall Village in the Territory of <hi>Vaga</hi> or <hi>Baga,</hi> ſhews that he was a Biſhop of a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory as well as of a Village; and for this cites <hi>Trithemius.</hi>
                  <note n="(s)" place="bottom">Trithem. de Script. Eccleſ.</note> I confeſs that the expreſſion of <hi>Trithemius</hi> does not conclude either for the largeneſs or ſtraitneſs of that Biſhoprick, which may be very large though the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſeat be a Village, or narrow though it have a City to give it denomination; unleſs our Author thinks, that becauſe there were but 500, or as he reckons 900 Dioceſes in <hi>Africk,</hi> there were no more Towns or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages in the whole Country.</p>
               <p>He is pleaſed to add, that <hi>he never yet could ſee any proof, any inſtance of a ſmall Village, that had ſo extended a Territory under one Biſhop.</hi> But did he ever ſee an inſtance of a Biſhop who had no Dioceſe but the ſingle Village in which he reſided? Or has he ever ſeen the limits of ſuch a Biſhoprick deſcribed? If he have, why does he not produce it? For one ſuch inſtance had been worth his whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about Village Biſhops. If he have not,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95441:96"/>
why does he uſe ſo much confidence when he is wholly in the dark? There are but very few ancient Dioceſes, that are delivered down to us with an account of their Circuit. But we happen to know the number that was of old in ſeveral Countries; and from thence can infer in general of the greatneſs and ſmallneſs of the Biſhopricks. And to give our Author one inſtance more in a Country he quotes for Village-Biſhops. In <hi>Cyprus,</hi> in <hi>Sozomen</hi>'s time it was uſual to have Biſhops in Villages; and yet in all that Iſland at that very time there were but nine Biſhops under one Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan, as appears from the ſubſcriptions of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
                  <note n="(t)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Conc. Chalc.</hi> Act. 6, &amp; 15.</note> For in the Copy of ſubſcriptions publiſh'd by <hi>Labbe</hi> from the Papers of <hi>Sirmond,</hi> there are ſix Subſcribers from that Iſland. And again the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſubſcribing with ſeveral others, for his Suffragans that were abſent, had but three remaining to ſubſcribe for. And therefore we muſt conclude, that either the Village-Biſhops had a conſiderable Territory, or the City Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks were enormouſly great.</p>
               <p>At laſt this Chapter concerning Village-Biſhops is brought to a Concluſion, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole matter I conceive two points to be very clear: 1. That although there were ſome Biſhops ſeated in Villages, yet it does by no means follow, that they were but Paſtors to a ſingle Congregation. 2. That a great
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95441:96"/>
number of places, which our Author took to be Villages, are prov'd to be Cities before he can find any Biſhops to be ſeated there. So that either the skill and the diligence of Mr. <hi>Clerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> were not ſo great, as his friends give out, who in theſe matters are very implicit believers; or elſe we muſt complain of want of ingenuity and fair dealing, a fault which the Saints are very eaſy to forgive, when it is committed in pure zeal to their Cauſe; but we Church of <hi>England</hi> men take for one of the blackeſt ſins.</p>

Some have been Cities and great from their firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, as <hi>Alexandria, Constantinople, Antioch,</hi> and many more; others by induſtry and good fortune have grown up by ſlow degrees from Villages to be Cities; and in their Progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when they are become equal to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Cities in every thing but Title and Priviledge, they are called Cities or Villages ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pleaſure of thoſe who ſpeak of them.

But beſides the childiſhneſs of the notion, our Author hath been unfortunate in

Nor is it neceſſary to inſiſt upon this; for <hi>Joſephus</hi> may ſpeak properly, though it ſhould be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he ſpoke of the ſame place. For before it was fortified by <hi>Judas Macchabaeus,</hi> it might be but a Village; but afterwards it is called a City, and the ſtrong and impregnable City. And being the only ſafe retreat of the <hi>Jews</hi> of that part of the Country, it muſt quickly grow populous enough to deſerve the Title, and to enjoy the priviledges of a City. And now we are ſpeaking of this place, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> it may not be amiſs to have it reſtored to its true Situation.

his Maps. But this can by no means be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with the relation which <hi>Joſephus</hi> gives of ſeveral Actions in the <hi>Maccabean</hi> Wars. When this City was beſieged by <hi>Antiochus Eupator, Judas</hi> left the Siege of the Cittadel of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and advanced towards the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my who lay before <hi>Bethſura;</hi> and having marched a conſiderable way, and poſted his men in a ſtrait place called <hi>Bethzacharia,</hi> he was then ſeventy furlongs from the Enemy, and from <hi>Bethſura.</hi> Beſides, in the Book of <hi>Macchabees</hi> it is ſaid to be built againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of the <hi>Idumaeans;</hi> which ſuppoſes it near their Borders, as indeed it was; for the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Copy has clear'd this point. For inſtead of five furlongs, we read there that it was five <hi>Schaeni</hi> from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now a <hi>Schaenus</hi> according to <hi>Herodotus,</hi>

City, without rendring it common to every Garriſon or Caſtle in the Country. <hi>Sebaſte</hi> too was an old City, and mentioned by <hi>Pliny</hi> among the chief of the Country; and let me intreat our new Criticks, that it may retain its old Title, though fallen a little into decay, without making way for every upſtart Village to come in and claim the dignity of a City. Theſe inſtances I was willing to account to his misfortune; but that of <hi>Avarum</hi> I muſt own as an act of dexterity. This is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as an ambiguous thing, between a City and a Village. And <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the great Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of the world is made to ſpeak doubtfully, as if he were not able to diſtinguiſh the kind. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> is of no kin to me; but for Truth and Juſtice ſake I am willing to do him right. For to declare the truth, that Author did never ſay that which Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> puts upon him. When men are poſitive, and quote Greek, eſpecially Fanaticks; one may be apt to think they found it ſomewhere, and never made the quotation. But here I muſt confeſs it happens to be otherwiſe; for poor <hi>Ptolomy</hi> is put upon. For he does not ſay that <hi>Avara</hi> is a City or a Village, but he places it in a part of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,</hi> among many other Towns; and it is unaccountable how our Author ſhould ſingle it from all the reſt. At the head of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there is a general Title: <hi>The Midland Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Villages of</hi> Arabia; and at ſome diſtance this place is ſet down. If the Title make it of an ambiguous kind, all the reſt that are named with it muſt be ſo too. Nay moſt of the Towns in <hi>Ptolomy</hi> muſt be of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95441:102"/>
becauſe the Title is very frequent in him. I was willing to ſuſpect my Edition, rather than the conſcience of my Author, who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from the Church of <hi>England</hi> out of pure tenderneſs of mind. But having examined other Editions, I found the old Heathen Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher was put upon by an Independent Saint. Some blunt men may in their plain way call this manner of dealing, forgery and falſifying; but towards godly men we muſt avoid rudeneſs, and let ſuch tricks as theſe paſs for Oeconomy, and dextrous management of a cauſe.</p>

I never yet heard of any, who denied that the Jews had Synagogues in Villages, as well as Cities. But that the Village-Synagogues were independent, and free from any ſubjection to the Cities in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, is now the queſtion; and our Author is wiſe in ſaying nothing of it. For thoſe who have taken his ſide of the queſtion, though men of good read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have not been able to produce any thing about it, but their own affirmations. It is not to be doubted, but every good Village of the Jews had a Synagogue, as every Pariſh with us hath a Church; and great Cities had many Synagogues, as our great Towns have many Pariſhes; and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> particularly is ſaid to have had 480. But that every Village-Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue had ſupream authority in matters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, and no dependance upon any other Court, or the chief officers of the City Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, is very unlikely.

ſide, and have aſſerted the Independence of every Synagogue, that every ſuch Aſſembly had a chief Officer anſwering to our Biſhops, and all co-ordinate and of equal authority. But for all this no evidence is produced; and when learned men ſpeak without book about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant matter of fact, their authority is but ſmall; for then they do not ſpeak from their knowledge and learning but their affection. The Scriptures of the old Teſtament give no directions concerning Synagogues, and do not ſo much as mention thoſe Aſſemblies. From whence ſome have concluded, that in thoſe times there were no ſuch religious Aſſemblies among the Jews. In the new Teſtament we have frequent mention of them, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their Officers are named; but how they were ordered in reſpect of one another, and of general Communion, the new Teſtament does not give the leaſt hint. Nay, as to this matter the writings of the Jews are not plain; and though they were, yet they taſte too much of the fable, to be depended upon. Great men may gueſs and affirm according as they ſtand affected; but when all is done, this matter is ſtill in the ſame obſcurity for want of ſufficient evidence. After the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Chriſtian Religion, we find ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Officers of the Jews endued with the power of Excommunication and Abſolution; but that every Village or City-conſiſtory had that power then, we do not find; and for ought appears, they might have no more power than our Church-wardens and Veſtries. Nay, in the complaint the Jews make to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadius</hi>

Our Legends and forg'd Decretals do as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the ſtate of the Primitive Church, as that Jewiſh Rhapſody does the ſtate of the Jewiſh Synagogue or Temple. But the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of theſe Forgeries being profoundly ignorant of what was Ancient and Primitive, drew the face of antiquity with ſome features of their own times. Hence it is, that the Jewiſh writers ſpeaking of thoſe times when their Nation and their Temple ſtood, drop unawares ſeveral paſſages that agree better with the ſtate of their diſperſion than eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment; and of this, the place alledg'd by our Author about Conſiſtories and Cities, gives a plain inſtance. For if we conſult <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi>

But if you conſider the Jews in their diſperſion; even <hi>Maimonides</hi> his way of ſpeaking will be proper; for there might be very great Cities, where the Jews had not a hundred Families; and they might retain ſo much of their old diſcipline, as to order ſome ſort of Conſiſtory in every City: and yet the eſtimate of their own Cities ought not to be taken from a miſerable Synagogue they might make when they were ſojourners in a ſtrange Country</p>

The improvement of Cities in other Countries happned to be later; for moſt of the great Cities of the Eaſt were rais'd by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and bear the names of them or ſome of their families.

to be ſo groſly impoſed upon. For it is as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to compare our Burroughs, or the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of our Cities, to the Cities of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, as it would be to compare <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> with old <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>England</hi> with the Roman Empire, or the reading of Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> with that of <hi>Plutarch</hi> or <hi>Pliny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Roman Empire had been torn in pieces, and divided between barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there was a new face and order of things. The <hi>Barbarian</hi> humor had ſomething wild and fierce in it, that would not agree with the way of living in Cities, and therefore the old Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſoon became deſolate. The Roman Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, which were nothing elſe, but ſo many combinations of Cities, all the Country being divided between them for Territory, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Counties inſtead of Cities. The people were forced to reſort to the Caſtle of the Count for Juſtice; and the wild way of life in ſcattered habitations returned again. And although in this part of the World we are much recovered from that barbarity, and may have ſome Cities not inferiour to the Roman greatneſs; yet in general our Towns and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are much below thoſe of old times. Nor can they well be otherwiſe, ſince they ſtand upon much narrower foundations as to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, than the Greek or Roman Cities. For our Cities are but ſo many exempts from the juriſdiction of the County, and have ſeldom any Juriſdiction half a mile beyond the walls, and beſides are generally but an Aſſembly of Tradeſmen. Whereas the Roman Cities were upon another bottom, every one having a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:95441:114"/>
as it were a County belonging to it, not only under the Juriſdiction of the City Magiſtrate, but divided between the City In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, who were the Lords of the adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Country. And therefore it is reaſonable to judge, that Cities of this kind would naturally become greater than ours, having ſo much greater encouragement and means of increaſe. What is here only ſaid, and in ſhort, ſhall be proved at large in another Chapter; where I ſhall conſider what is alledged by our Author concerning the Territories of ancient Cities. In the mean time I will reply to the Inſtances of great Cities with ſmall circumference; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though what is already ſaid may be ſufficient to excuſe me from any farther labour about this matter, having ſhewn already, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pertinent it is to the preſent queſtion.</p>
               <p>The way which our Author takes of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring Cities by their Circumference is very groſs and uncertain, and has been expoſed long ago by <hi>Polybius,</hi> as a vulgar conceit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the ignorance of the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Geometry.

Thucid. l. 1. p. 4.</note> of judging of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a City is not from the Circuit of the walls, but from its force and multitude of Inhabitants. For it is not the ſpace of ground on which it ſtands, but the people that render it great. For many Towns of a ſmall compaſs have ſo ſwarm'd with people, that they have ſurpaſs'd Cities above three times their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in real greatneſs. Such was <hi>Aradus,</hi> of which we have given an account already; ſuch was <hi>Tyre</hi> of old, if we ſhould admit our Authors ſurvey of it; for it fill'd the World with its Colonies. <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Septis,</hi> and <hi>

And that we may not ſuſpect theſe ancient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the greatneſs of ſo ſmall a place, as incredible; <hi>Algiers</hi> is ſufficient to convince us of the poſſibility of the thing.

I might add ſeveral more of great Circuit, which were much inferiour to <hi>Tyre</hi> in force and reputation; ſo that upon this account it is no very ſure way of judging of Cities by their Circumference.</p>
               <p>There is yet another reaſon, why we cannot depend upon our Authors way of meaſuring Cities; becauſe the Circumference generally mentioned by ancient Authors is only that of the wall, and then the Suburbs is omitted, which is ſometimes little leſs than the City it ſelf;<note n="(r)" place="bottom">Dion.

If we ſhould take the meaſure of <hi>London</hi> from its walls, it might ſeem to thoſe who judge of Cities after our Author's way, to be but an ordinary Town; eſpecially if to leſſen its compaſs, it ſhould be thrown into a round figure. <hi>Colen</hi> might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſeem to ſuch Judges the greater place of the two, becauſe it has<note n="(z)" place="bottom">Bert. de Urb.

So un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain is this way of judging of the greatneſs of Cities, and making compariſons between them, from their Circumference.

The Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a dream; the compaſs of the Iſland and of the City was the ſame both before and ſince the taking of it by <hi>Alexander;</hi> and though it might be but narrow in reſpect of Cities accounted great, yet the height of the houſes made amends for the ſmallneſs of the <hi>Area,</hi> and made it equal to the chiefeſt Cities.

               <p>Our Author having obſerved, that there were ſeveral ſizes of ancient Cities, and the greateſt he thought fit to mention being not three miles in compaſs, he comes to draw his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,<note n="(y)" place="bottom">Prim. ep. p. 53.</note> that <hi>their leſſer Cities were but like our ordinary Villages; their middle ſort of Cities were like our Market-Towns or Burroughs, (we have ſome that may compare with their great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) or like their larger Villages, ſuch as</hi> Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian <hi>noted in</hi> Piſidia, &amp;c. I was afraid when our Author began his obſervations concerning Cities, that the Ancients had no Villages at all, but that all places with them had been Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Now I am much better ſatisfied, when I find that they had great Villages as well as ſmall, and ſome equal to our Market-Towns; ſo that in thoſe days when the Cities were ſmall the Villages were great, and many not inferiour to Towns of worſhipful Title. Our Author did not conſider well the conſequence
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95441:119"/>
of this great ſecret, which he is pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal. For of thoſe great and populous Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages there was not one in a hundred that had a Biſhop, but were Pariſhes to the City Biſhop, though his City might be as ſmall as any of thoſe dwarf Towns which our Author has produced. So that all his pains are come to nothing, that he had taken in diminiſhing the ſeats of the ancient Biſhops; ſince there were great and ſmall Villages then, as well as now, to make up their Dioceſes. But let us ſee how the caſe of our Biſhops differs from that of their Primitive Predeceſſors. According to the Inquiſition made by Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> concerning ancient Epiſcopal ſeats, ſeveral of our Biſhops are ſeated in Villages, others have Cities for their ſeats which are not much ſuperiour to Villages; and the moſt of their Epiſcopal Cities are not greater than the chief of our Market-Towns. Nay <hi>Canterbury</hi> it ſelf, the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> is not ſo great as the Burrough of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark.</hi> What conſequence this may have in the reaſoning and diſputes of after-ages, I dare not divine. He that ſhall be ſo induſtrious as to pick this out of ſome ſcattered papers which time may render venerable, may like Mr. <hi>Clerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> acquire the reputation of a learned man and a very harmleſs Adverſary.</p>
               <p>It ill becomes us of this Nation to vye Cities with the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and much more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd is it to ſet up our Villages and Market-Towns in competition with thoſe <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Cities that were diſtinguiſhed by their greatneſs. For few that read can be ignorant that our Cities, generally ſpeaking, are much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95441:120"/>
to thoſe of our Neighbours. Thoſe of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> do much excel ours; and yet there are none of, theſe that will undergo the envy of ſuch a competition. <hi>Italy</hi> has as many great Towns in proportion as any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> except the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> and yet how much is it fallen from its ancient greatneſs? About 1500 years ago it was all covered with Cities, and many of them great and populous; and to ſpeak modeſtly of its decay, it ſeems not to have a tenth part of the people which it had then; and its Cities fallen at preſent as much ſhort of thoſe ancient ones, few only excepted, as the preſent <hi>Rome</hi> is from that which was miſtreſs of the world. <hi>France</hi> may be now more populous and flouriſhing than when it was a <hi>Roman</hi> Province; yet the Cities are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally<note n="(z)" place="bottom">Recherches de Paſq. l. 2. c. 16.</note> inferiour to the old <hi>Roman</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. For while they are left to trades like the other Towns of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Nobility live in their Caſtles in the Country, or in the Court, and the Country is ſeparated by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction and intereſt from the Cities, it is ſcarce poſſible that they ſhould equal the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ancient times, when there was no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility but in Cities, no quality higher than a Citizen.</p>
               <p>By theſe inſtances of Cities accounted great and yet of narrow compaſs, our Author would inſinuate, that any thing beyond this meaſure of twenty furlongs was extraordinary; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:95441:120"/>
Cities double in circuit to theſe were ſcarce accounted great. What proportion the old Cities of any reputation in ſtory might bear to ours, will appear from the Examples I am going to produce, and a more juſt calculation of ancient greatneſs. I do not intend to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the extravagance of ſome late Writers, who can ſpeak nothing of ancient or remote people but miracles, and make more Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in one City, than half <hi>Europe</hi> can reckon. It is really a wrong both to men and to Cities, to give them a character that is incredible. Their real merit, which might be very great, and beyond competition, is loſt, when dreſſed up in Romantick faſhion, and raiſed beyond all belief and poſſibility. Wherefore in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which I ſhall give of ancient Cities which became Biſhops ſeats, I ſhall confine my ſelf to the expreſs teſtimonies of ancient Writers; and when any computation is to be made by gueſs, I will take care rather to err by an under-reckoning, than ſtretching too far.</p>
               <p>Within the compaſs of the Roman Empire there were many Cities accounted vaſt, and theſe I think are not to be equalled by any which later ages have produced. Theſe were the wonders of old time, and ſtill remain ſo to us in the deſcriptions and ruins that remain of them. <hi>Rome</hi> was a prodigy of a City, and <hi>Servius</hi>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95441:121"/>
rather than a City. The <hi>French</hi> vanity has transferred<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Andr. du Cheſne.

               <p>Theſe inſtances may ſeem to be lyable to the ſame exceptions with the former; for it may be ſaid that theſe were rare in reſpect of the number of leſſer Cities, and that not one in fifty was ſo great. It is confeſs'd, nor are they alledg'd with a deſign of perſuading that the greater part were of this ſize; but ſince theſe were frequent, and moſt Countries had ſome, it is reaſonable to conceive, that when ancient Writers ſpeak of great Cities, they may have ſome regard to theſe, and not be thought to magnifie ſuch mean places as our market-Towns, when they had ſo many Cities like <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Paris</hi> in their view. Wherefore to come yet lower, there were Cities accounted great, that wanted half of the circuit of one
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95441:126"/>
of theſe. <hi>Lacedaemon</hi>
                  <note n="(e)" place="bottom">Polib. l. 9.</note> was a great City, tho' but ſix miles in compaſs; yet this was not the old <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> that contended with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> for the Principality of <hi>Greece,</hi> for that had neither walls nor contiguity, but was built ſcatterdly after the manner of Villages, as <hi>Thucidides</hi>

It would be endleſs to reckon Cities of this degree, ſince ſo many happen'd to have this meaſure, which were neither Metropoles of Provinces, nor any other way remarkable, as ſome of theſe Cities mention'd were not. Now, even theſe are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in our time great Cities. This is the compaſs of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> if <hi>Pontanus</hi>
                  <note n="(i)" place="bottom">Pontan. Hiſt.

About this pitch we may ſix the point of greatneſs, ſo that what is below it, is not to be accounted great in reſpect of circuit; tho' it may happen, that in half this compaſs a great force of people may be contein'd. <hi>Vienna</hi> is accounted<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s Deſcript. of <hi>Vienna.</hi> p. 133.</note> among the chief Cities of the Empire, and yet it is ſcarce three miles in compaſs; yet for number of people is inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95441:126"/>
or to very few. And after this manner Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi>'s riddle of little-great Cities is to be reſolv'd. The ſize is but mean, and belongs to little Towns, but ſomething accidental and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in ſuch a bigneſs may happen to raiſe ſome few to a higher quality, than their outward proſpect might challenge. The circuit of <hi>Emporium</hi> was three miles, and yet it is never reckon'd among the great Cities of <hi>Spain. Phocaea,</hi> one of the twelve Cities of <hi>Ionia,</hi> and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them, was little leſs.

               <p>As to the rights and priviledges by which Cities were diſtinguiſh'd from Villages, they were of two ſorts, either ſuch as concern'd Religion, or thoſe that belonged to civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.

And it is obſerv'd<note n="(t)" place="bottom">Dio. Chr. Or. 39. Polyb. l. 4. p. 468. l. 113 &amp; Decur. Cod.

Now the priviledges of our Cities, tho' they bear ſome reſemblance to thoſe of which I have been ſpeaking, yet are they much ſhort of them in reſpect both of fulneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of juriſdiction, which with us ſeldom reaches beyond the walls of the City; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Greek and Roman way of Government, a City had as it were a County belonging to it; ſo that our Cities are but exempts from the County, whereas thoſe of ancient times were the Lords and the Judges of the Counties in
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95441:130"/>
which they were ſeated. Such were the Cities of the Roman Empire when Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was firſt preach'd in them; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles or their ſucceſſours who planted Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and appointed Biſhops in the Cities where they preach'd, did not think fit to preſcribe any new bounds, but accomodated themſelves to the limits of the ſeveral Cities, which as they were very unequal, occaſion'd the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Dioceſes to become ſo too. But this made no quarrel in ancient times; for there were then neither Presbyterians nor Independents to call for new <hi>Agrarian</hi> Diviſions in the Church of God. That therefore which our Author<note n="(u)" place="bottom">Prim. ep. p. 54.</note> affirms of ancient Cities, that they were but <hi>priviledg'd Villages, and that a wall or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as inconſiderable</hi> made the only difference, muſt proceed either from ignorance of the ſtate of ancient Cities, or what is worſe, from an intention to deceive. Nor yet do thoſe who grant Biſhops to leſſer Cities, <hi>leave themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without reaſon to deny them to Villages;</hi> for the difference was more than a wall or a formality.</p>
               <p>Our Author<note n="(x)" place="bottom">Prim. ep. p 54.</note> goes on to confound Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and Cities, and obſerves that <hi>Bethlega is a Village in</hi> Joſephus. <hi>But</hi> Jonathan <hi>having wall'd it, immediately after he calls it a City.</hi> There were many Villages in the South of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> that were not only as populous as ordinary Cities, but great Communities,

                  <hi>It is taken for a Rule,</hi> ſays our Author, <hi>that where there is a</hi> Defenſor Civitatis, <hi>there was a Biſhop; and</hi> Juſtinian <hi>appoints ſuch a</hi> Defenſor, —<hi>not only of the great Cities, but of the leſs.— And there is a Law in the</hi> Code, <hi>that every City ſhould have a Biſhop,—without exception of little or great, but only two,</hi> Tomis <hi>and</hi> Leontopolis, <hi>which afterwards had its Biſhop, and</hi> Tomis <hi>before.</hi> He muſt be very unreaſonable, who finds fault with this Rule. And now that our Author ſpeaks reaſon, and plain things, God forbid he ſhould be contradicted. When men who delight in paradoxes and ſingular fancies, happen to be in the right, it is a great ſin to oppoſe them. Let every City have its Biſhop, and ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions as cuſtom hath preſcribed, be allowed, till there be reaſon for a change. There is ſurely from this no hurt to the Dioceſan way, nor any ſervice done to Independent Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. Yet I cannot but take notice, that our Author, after his uſual manner, ſtumbles here too upon plain ground; and the remark he thinks fit to make upon the exceptions in this Law, ſhews he did not underſtand it. <hi>Tomis</hi> he obſerves <hi>had a Biſhop before</hi> this exception was made; as if the Law had ſuggeſted that

                  <hi>For one Biſhop in a great City, there was ten, ſometimes twenty, ſometimes more in the leſſer Towns; and more there had been, had not the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of following Ages, with a</hi> non obſtante <hi>to the Apostles rule, judged a ſmall place unbeſeeming the honour and greatneſs of a Biſhop.</hi> That the leſſer Cities were much more numerous than the great, is readily granted; that theſe leſſer Cities were no bigger than the generality of our Market-Towns, after all our Author has done, requires farther proof. We have indeed ſome Market-Towns that are not inferiour to Cities, but then they are not for our Author's purpoſe; for they have many Pariſhes and Churches, and cannot be crowded into one Congregation. Cities very ſmall were likewiſe very rare, and the generality were too great for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Biſhop. It was not the ambition of after-ages, that forbad the making of Biſhops in mean places; but when a Biſhop was a name of great honour, and had many civil priviledges annexed to it, it was the ambition of vain men that inſtigated them to endeavour to be Biſhops though in a Village, and places where there never had been any before; and it was the wiſdom of the Church to put a ſtop to that ambition, and by that means to ſecure the unity of the Church and the poſſibility of a general Communion. But our Author com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, that <hi>in ſome ſuch places where they had
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95441:135"/>
been ſettled, they were extinguiſhed, and in other places they were united. So</hi> Phulla <hi>was united to</hi> Sugdaea, <hi>and ſo</hi> Tyropolis <hi>to</hi> Alania. Theſe Inſtances might have been ſpared, for they are too new for our preſent purpoſe, being of the twelfth or thirteenth Century. And theſe were not joyn'd becauſe the Dioceſes were ſmall: For thoſe of <hi>Bulgary,</hi> to which the firſt inſtance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain, were very large without thoſe Unions; and in the other, <hi>Alania</hi> is not the name of a Town, but of a Nation. But the queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about Primitive Dioceſes, it had been more to the purpoſe to have ſhewn of what extent they were for the firſt three hundred years, and then to have inform'd us what alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſucceding ages had made as to the bounds of ancient Biſhopricks; how ſome came to be extinguiſh'd, and others to be united. But the ages that next followed the time, to which our Author confines his Primitive Epiſcopacy, were ſo far from ſinking or uniting Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, that they divided thoſe old ones, and made many of one; and yet after all, they were ſtill of the Dioceſan way, as will appear hereafter. The reducing of the Biſhopricks of <hi>Sardinia</hi> to ſeven, is likewiſe late; and when they were moſt, they were Dioceſan and not Congregational: And in the fifth Century<note n="(r)" place="bottom">Not. Africae. Ed. Sirmond.</note> they were not ſo many as they are now, for they were but five. As for the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks of <hi>Ireland</hi> and of <hi>Italy,</hi> they have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

                  <hi>I will not ſay that many of the Biſhops there were Arrians, tho' the Oriental Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates preſent there ſhew'd themſelves immediately after at</hi> Philippopolis; <hi>and the Arrians were branded for not being contented with ſmall Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks.</hi> Some men can uſe very crafty figures of ſpeech, when they have nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>I will not ſay:</hi> But why I pray? There lies no Action of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> from thoſe Biſhops; he might ſafely venture to ſay any thing of them that he knew to be true. Yet the modeſt diffident man <hi>will not ſay they were Arrians?</hi> No, <hi>he will not ſay it</hi> forſooth. But is there any ground for ſuch a ſuſpicion? The good man <hi>will not ſay it.</hi> Why then does he ſay, that he will not ſay it? <hi>Tho' the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental Prelates preſent there, ſhew'd themſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after at</hi> Philippolis: Yet for all this, he will not ſay <hi>that many of them were Arrians.</hi> A captious man may take this to be nonſenſe,

but I will not ſay it. When a Diſſenter mumbles after this manner; it is not altogether for the elegance of the figure, but when he knows that what he offers for an argument is either a lye, or not to the purpoſe, then ſuch reſerves as this ſerve to bring him off in caſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, for he would not ſay it then for all the World: and this is the preſent caſe. Our Author had a mind to diſparage the Council of <hi>Sardica</hi> for this Canon, that forbids the making of Biſhops in Villages and ſuch ſmall Cities where there had been none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; to take away their credit he intimates that many of the Biſhops were <hi>Arrians.</hi> Some <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhops came<note n="(u)" place="bottom">Ep.

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:95441:137"/>
were branded for not being contented with ſmall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks.</hi> By which obſervation our Author would ſuggeſt, if the Reader will take it, that theſe <hi>Arrians</hi> made that Canon, which forbids Biſhops to be ordein'd in ſmall Cities, becauſe they were not content with ſmall Biſhopricks; whereas this Canon was made againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations of the Arrians, who made Biſhops in ſuch ſmall places where there never had been any before.

               <p>The next exception againſt this Synod is,<note n="(z)" place="bottom">Prim. ep. p. 62.</note> that <hi>it was of little authority, not admitted by the Greeks into their Code till the Trullan Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.— Nor by the Latins ſome ages after it was held,</hi> &amp;c.— <hi>Nor by the African Churches, who rejected, and would not be oblig'd by its Canons for Appeals to</hi> Rome. How ſoon or late this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod was generally receiv'd, does little concern the Canon in diſpute, which does not eſtabliſh any thing new, but only affirms ancient Practice. And if the matter of this Canon was generally obſerv'd, where the Synod of <hi>Sardica</hi> was not yet owned, it is plain, that this matter depends upon better authority than the ſanction of a Council; immemorial Cuſtom, and the general agreement of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Without regard to this Canon, the bounds
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:95441:137"/>
of ancient. Biſhopricks were accounted ſacred, and not lightly to be changed. Some Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages in <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> accounted conſiderable enough to make a Dioceſe in troubleſom times, becauſe they had immemorially been annex'd to the Epiſcopal City, were judged by their poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to have been ſettl'd in that condition by Apoſtolical Order, and therefore the people of thoſe places were earneſt they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to their firſt dependance. The Region <hi>Mareotes</hi> was large enough to make a good Dioceſe of it ſelf; yet when a Biſhop was ſet up in one part of it, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that it was done againſt ancient Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which in ſuch caſes as theſe, was to take place. <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> having made a Biſhop in a mean place, where there had been none before, is blam'd, as a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator of the eſtabliſh'd Order of the Church. So that if the Synod of <hi>Sardica</hi> was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any where, for many ages after it was held; yet this Canon againſt making Biſhops in ſmall places where there had been none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was it ſeems generally approv'd, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the matter of it was accounted equal and fit. There are Orders of other Synods in the ſame age, to the ſame effect; and I do not know of any ancient Aſſembly, or ſo much as a ſingle Writer, that ever made any exception againſt this Rule. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when Biſhops were ordein'd in ſmall places, where there had been none before, we find complaints againſt it, as a violation of old eſtabliſhment; and even in <hi>Afric,</hi> where ſuch innovations grew frequent, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints

The deſign therefore of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in that paſſage is to ſet out the character of <hi>Ignatius</hi> to advantage, from the greatneſs of the City, of which he was Biſhop; and to ſet off the City, he compares it with the loweſt or meaneſt Congregations; but does not give the leaſt intimation that no one Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter had greater, or that a place of more inhabitants than a hundred and fifty requir'd the care of a Biſhop. If to commend the chief Magiſtrate of ſome very great City, one ſhould borrow this of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and ſay, that it is a difficult thing to govern a Family of twenty people, or to keep good order in a Town of but two hundred inhabitants; and therefore his endowments muſt be extraordinary, into whoſe hands the government of ſo great a City is committed; he would be thought a very ſtrange Critick, who from ſuch a complement
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:95441:139"/>
ſhould remark, that a Family ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of no more than twenty; or that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable ought not to undertake the keeping of the peace in a Village that has more than two hundred inhabitants; and therefore where there is a greater number, it requires a Mayor and Aldermen to undertake the charge. Or if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Commemoration of ſome Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the Preacher ſhould think fit to turn the greatneſs of the City into a Topic of that Biſhops commendation, and ſay, that a cure of a hundred and fifty Souls is a great and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult charge, and great care to be us'd in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding even for ſuch a place an able Paſtor; and therefore what wonderful abilities muſt he be thought maſter of, who was judg'd capable of being the Paſtor of ſo vaſt a City. Would any man that is awake conclude from hence, that there is never a Pariſh-Presbyter in <hi>England,</hi> that had a greater cure? So pertinent is that <hi>direction</hi> which our Author fancy'd to have found in <hi>Chryſoſtom for understanding punctually what numbers they</hi> anciently <hi>thought ſufficient for one Presbyter.</hi> To the ſame effect he proceeds to tell us,<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Prim. ep. p. 63.</note> that <hi>upon this account one Presbyter was not thought ſufficient for a place that contain'd three or four hundred inhabitants.</hi> For this we deſire ſome proof, but I am affraid we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect long. There is one thing more in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors remarks upon the Canon of <hi>Sardica,</hi> that deſerves to be taken notice of; and that is, that where one Presbyter is not ſufficient, there a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:95441:139"/>
Biſhop ought to be ordein'd. It is a rule he has made to himſelf, by inverting the Canon of <hi>Sardica,</hi> that forbids the making of a Biſhop in a very little City, where even one Presbyter may ſuffice. Now the practice of antiquity was very different in this caſe from what our Author fancies; for there were ſeveral Towns that had no Biſhops, which had not only many Presbyters, but many Congregations. <hi>Bethleem</hi> was but a Village belonging to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>

                  <hi>was but twenty furlongs in circumference.</hi> That <hi>Peluſium</hi> was accounted a great City in <hi>Strabo</hi>'s time, or was <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> of any part of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is only an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Author, which is always very favourable and ſubſervient to his notion.

                  <hi>As for Cities that were greater and more populous.— In them the Chriſtians for ſome ages were no more than could aſſemble in one place, the inhabitants conſiſting moſt of Heathens with Jews, and thoſe of the Chriſtian profeſſion that were not of the Communion, nor would aſſemble with the Biſhop.</hi> I will not deny, that for ſome
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:95441:149"/>
ages the number of Chriſtians were inferior to that of the Heathen. But then this being allow'd, it will not follow that all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the greateſt Cities might aſſemble in one place of worſhip; for ſome Cities were ſo great, that a hundred Churches could not receive all the people. Suppoſe therefore in <hi>Rome</hi> for inſtance, a million of Souls, which I think is the loweſt eſtimate that was ever made of that People. If for the three firſt ages but a tenth part was Chriſtian, not twenty Churches, ſuch as the Chriſtians were provided of at that time, could ſuffice. In <hi>London,</hi> tho' thoſe of the Communion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> be much the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and make up the groſs of the People; yet the Diſſenters, were they willing to joyn in one Congregation, would not be able to meet in one place. And their way of ſervice makes them more capable of great Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than the Primitive Chriſtians; ſince ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking, they ſeem to have no other publick act of Religious Worſhip, but to hear. Nay, there is ſcarce any one Sect of them ſo mean, but would think themſelves Perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould all of that Sect within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of <hi>London</hi> be ſtinted to one place of meeting. <hi>Amſterdam</hi> may exceed <hi>London</hi> in number of Sects, tho' it be inferior to it in number of people; the Jews there inhabit one good quarter, the Papiſts are ſo numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that I have heen inform'd, they have near thirty Chappels within that City; the <hi>Lutherans</hi> there have ſeveral Churches; to ſay nothing of other Sects that are very numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:95441:149"/>
Yet thoſe of the eſtabliſh'd Religion are reckon'd the greater part, and require many Churches for their Worſhip. But to return to the Primitive Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>That we may better conceive the ſtate of the Chriſtians in the firſt three ages, let us conſider how it was poſſible for them to thrive, and at laſt to become Maſters of the Roman Empire under all thoſe great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to which they were all the while ſubject. They had ſeldom any friends in Court; and there are but two Reigns in all that time, in which they had any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; but were frequently ſet upon by the Emperors, and perſecuted with full intent of utter extirpation. They could make no Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the State, for the roots of popular government had been pluck'd up, and the government of the Empire was too abſolute to bear any thing of that nature. They had no power in the Army, for there were but few of them employ'd that way, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking, they did not like the ſervice. Yet for all this, in leſs than three ages they poſſeſſed themſelves of the Empire, and gave laws to the Heathen. Now if we ſpeak hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly of this matter, we can reſolve it into no other cauſe than the great number of the Chriſtians. It muſt be confeſſed, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God was wonderful in preſerving and raiſing this meek and ſimple people; but the means he choſe were the ſame he had taken before in <hi>Egypt</hi> for the deliverance of <hi>Iſrael: he increaſed them exceedingly, and ſo made them ſtronger than their enemies.</hi>

                  <hi>But for all this, it does not appear that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in that City were more than could meet together in one place.</hi> And to make it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that all the City made but one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, he offers two things. Firſt, <hi>That we ſaw before</hi> that this place <hi>was not very populous:</hi> And then, that <hi>Gregory</hi> built but one Church there; <hi>he would doubtleſs have erected more, if more had been needful.</hi> The firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has been rejected already, and they muſt be very eaſy that admit it; becauſe eleven <hi>Egyptian</hi> Biſhops were baniſhed to this place, therefore it had no more people than could meet in one Church. Yet as weak as this is, the other is no wiſer; becauſe <hi>Gregory</hi> built but one Church, therefore there were no more. Nay, tho' he might have built ſeveral Pariſh-Churches, yet the Cathedral, which by the ancients is called <hi>the Church</hi> by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, might be only mention'd; and in the great Cities, where we are ſure there were many Churches, they ſpeak of <hi>the Church,</hi> that is, the Biſhops; as if there were no other in the place, and there was but one Church in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:95441:151"/>
any City for ſome uſes of Religion, that is, for Baptiſm and Penance. So that to ſpeak properly, and after the manner of ancient times, there was in a City but one Church, the other being but Pariſh-Chappels and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratories. <hi>Gregory</hi> therefore might build but one Church, and yet his City might have many Pariſh-Congregations. But for <hi>Neocaeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> we have greater probabilities that it was too populous for one Religious Aſſembly.

For where there were no Chriſtians at all, it is in vain to enquire for the bounds of Epiſcopacy. But this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion turns againſt our Authors own notion.

But that paſſage of <hi>Sozomen</hi> muſt not be taken too ſtrictly; for then it will not be true.

But of <hi>Antioch</hi> there will be occaſion to ſay more hereafter. <hi>In</hi> Arabia, Moſes <hi>being ſent Biſhop there, found but few Chriſtians;</hi> that is, the <hi>Saracens</hi> under Queen <hi>Mavia</hi> had but few Chriſtians, when that Biſhop was ſent to them.

generally Heathen.

But one thing he offers, that ought not to be omitted, that,<note n="(y)" place="bottom">Prim. ep. p. 81.</note> 
                  <hi>Chryſoſtom ſeems to ſignifie, that in his time, they were as many as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in that City,</hi> i. e. in <hi>Antioch; for he exhorts each of the Christians to reduce one Jew to the Chriſtian profeſſion.</hi> To ſay the truth, this inference does not ſo much as <hi>ſeem</hi> to be reaſonable. For firſt <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> could not ſpeak to all the Chriſtians of <hi>Antioch</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though his voice had been as great as his eloquence; and to ſtrain this expreſſion to the utmoſt, if it ſhould ſuppoſe the <hi>Jews</hi> as many as thoſe he addreſsed his diſcourſe to, yet would they be no more than one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Congregation, which might poſſibly be two or three thouſand when <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; though that great man ſometimes in his Sermons complains of the ſmallneſs of his auditory. But this is not neceſſary. For the language of a Preacher is not to be examined by the rules of an accountant; nor when he exhorts every one to convert his man, is he ſuppoſed to be telling of heads, and comparing of parties. But ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> would admit no publick exhortation then, as they do endure in ſome places ſince for forms ſake; this zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour Preacher for the advancement of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and the ſaving of Souls, might direct his people, as they have occaſion, to deal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately and apart with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to endeavour every one to gain his convert.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:95441:167"/>And this I have ſaid to ſhew the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſiveneſs of Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi>'s arguments. But in truth the whole is a down-right fraud. For St. <hi>Chryſostom</hi> in the place cited, directs not every Chriſtian to convert his Jew; but every zealous and faithful Chriſtian to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reclaim or convert his brother, and that whether Heathen, or Jew, or (which he there chiefly intends) negligent Chriſtian. A little before he had lamented the careleſneſs of Chriſtian maſters, who permitted their wives or ſervants to frequent the Theaters, or the Synagogues of the Jews; when it was in their power to reſtrain them, and by that influence which they had over them, diſpoſe them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to embrace the Chriſtian Religion, or more ſtrictly live up to the rules of it, if already embraced. For this frequenting of the Jewiſh Synagogues in theſe perſons, aroſe not from the belief of the Jewiſh Religion, but from the ſame vanity which induced them to frequent the Theaters, that is, the pleaſure of ſeeing pompous and even theatrical cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies practiſed in them. For ſo <hi>Chryſostom</hi> argueth with them. <hi>Tell me, what is it that you run to ſee in the Synagogue of the Jews? To hear men ſound with trumpets?</hi> For it appears, that the Jews retained that cuſtom, and ſtrived to perform it with great art, in their religious ſervice; which might draw great numbers of idle perſons, whether Chriſtians or Heathens, to hear them. Such perſons ought no more be ſuppoſed to have been Jews, than all thoſe to have been Papiſts, whoſe vain curioſity tempted them to enter the Popiſh Chappels in the laſt reign.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:95441:167"/>As for the Jews diſperſed over the Empire, it does not appear they were in any City ſo numerous as to bear any near proportion to the inhabitants of the place. Of old indeed in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and ſome Cities of <hi>Syria,</hi> they were exceeding numerous: But then they were original inhabitants of thoſe places, and not ſtrangers. But in the fourth Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of which we are now ſpeaking, tho' every where almoſt there were ſome, yet were there not very many in any one place, excepting their own Country. We may judge by what we ſee now; there is ſcarce any great Town of trade in <hi>Europe,</hi> where there are not ſome Jews. And in many Countries they may be ſaid to be numerous; but ſtill they bear no proportion to the Natives. And I do not know, whether there be any City in <hi>Europe</hi> where they are ſo many in proportion to the other people, as one to an hundred. And this is ſo ſmall a matter, that it does not deſerve any conſideration. It is as if in the computation of what water a river may diſcharge in a day, a man ſhould be ſcrupulous to make allowance for the drinking of a few Horſes.</p>
               <p>When he had brought Chriſtians very low, by great favour and partiality towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Jews; he thinks fit at laſt to divide this ſmall party, and with a true ſpirit of a Diſſenter, to draw away as many as he could from the Communion of the Biſhop.

And <hi>in</hi> Rome, Innocent <hi>took many Churches from them: And</hi> Celeſtine <hi>deprived them of more.</hi> And to conclude, <hi>till that time they had mightily flouriſhed at</hi> Rome, <hi>having many Churches and great multitudes of People.</hi> What, had theſe <hi>Novatians</hi> then many Churches in one City? I had almoſt been tempted to think by Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi>'s former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that one Church had been ſufficient for all the Chriſtians of the greateſt City in the Empire; and yet it ſeems one ſingle Sect could not be content with one Church, but they muſt have many under one Biſhop.

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:95441:169"/>
                  <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> under one Biſhop. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, or eſtabliſhed Chriſtians before this time upon a very low computation, were twenty times as many; and theſe with all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Pariſhes of that Dioceſe, had but one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: yet they are to have but one Church, if our Author may have his way. <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> are a great way off; and the times of which our Author ſpeaks, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remote from ours. But let us try whether we may not comprehend this matter without travel or much reading, and make <hi>London</hi> the Scene of our Diſcourſe; for as great and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous as it is, it may receive no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the compariſon with old or new <hi>Rome.</hi> Now in <hi>London</hi> there is a Sect or two ambitious of being thought to have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to the <hi>Novatians;</hi> and that they may not be diſpleaſed, let them be more numerous; inſtead of three Churches, let them have ten Meetings. The other Sects who can ſpeak of numbers too, may have their aſſemblies as convenient as they pleaſe, and not cruſh or hurt one another for want of room; yet the Biſhop of the place will ſcarce be able to aſſemble his flock, even of the City, in any one Church, tho' <hi>Pauls</hi> were finiſhed: For if you ſhould happen to be late on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning; go to St. <hi>Clements,</hi> and there's no room; go to St. <hi>Martins,</hi> and its all full; go to the <hi>Abby,</hi> and you can ſcarce come within hearing; and at St. <hi>Gile</hi>'s, you will be throng'd; and if you walk to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> you may have no ſeat. I might add near a hundred Congregations more within the lines,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:95441:169"/>
of which many are as conſiderable as theſe I mentioned, and all this in a City which is much inferior for number of people to thoſe old ones of which our Author ſpeaks. You may ſee therefore by this, how much thinner a multitude of Sects, and ſome of them nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, will render the Biſhops flock, in ſuch great Cities as we have been ſpeaking of; and what mighty abatements are to be made in the number of the Church Chriſtians, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of three Conventicles of the <hi>Novatians,</hi> in a City that wanted not much of a million of Souls. But we have made no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for Heathen, which in the fourth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury were numerous, and now are grown rare. But the ſluggiſh and irreligious brutes in our greateſt Cities may be reconed againſt them, and our account remain as it was; and I am afraid that about <hi>London</hi> there may be more of theſe, than there were Heathens in <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>

Wherefore thinking they had done well and wiſely, they return home in great hopes that the Eaſt and Weſt were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and that this ſmall alteration had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got an eternal Peace.

What therefore if <hi>Euſebius</hi> by all this citation ſhould intend only to commend the diligence and the penetration of that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Tyre,</hi> that he had the gift of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits, and of judging aright, whoſe repentance was ſincere, and therefore to be received into communion; whoſe converſion was unfeigned, and therefore to be admitted to baptiſm; who was beſt qualified for the reſpective offices of the Church? If he ſhould mean no more by theſe high expreſſions, he would not exceed much the allowances given to ſuch kinds of diſcourſe; and I think they are more to blame, that would force a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into a Syllogiſm.

And all this might be ſaid, although he had had forty Pariſh-Churches within his City. <hi>Valeſius</hi> mentions a marginal note of ſome Greek ſet againſt this place, in a Manuſcript that he had ſeen, deteſting it as a wicked and blaſphemous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.

That in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time Sectaries could not leſſen the Church of the Biſhop in that place, ſince they were not only diſcountenanced in that reign, but by the Edicts of the Emperour obliged to go to Church, which they generally did obſerve; ſome ſincerely, and the reſt by outward compliance.

               <p>THe unjuſt Steward in the Goſpel, being called to give up his accounts, and then to be diſcharged, provided for himſelf at the expence of his Lord; and cutting off conſiderably from the ſumm owing to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, procured himſelf a retreat among the debtors. Yet in this unrighteous contrivance he obſerved ſome meaſure, and reduced a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred but to fourſcore, and fourſcore to fifty. But Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> in the account he makes of his Maſter's ſubſtance in ancient Cities, is much more profuſe towards the debters; and in ſome places, of a hundred does not leave ten. But in this he has choſen to follow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice rather than the wiſdom of the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard: for when his defalcations come to be ſo unlikely and extravagant, it is impoſſible the reckoning ſhould paſs. Had he inſiſted only on leſſer Cities, that for three or four ages the Chriſtians in them might not exceed one Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the account might have paſſed without any ſuſpicion, tho' the evidence even for this be defective. But when in the greateſt Cities of the World he ſets down but one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the account of Chriſt, and will not allow ſcarce five of a hundred to belong to our Lord, the miſreckoning is too manifeſt, and does not carry ſo much as the appearance of truth.</p>

                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:95441:184"/>The increaſe of Chriſtianity is repreſented by the Scripture of the New Teſtament, and by the Writers of the ages immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, as wonderful and unexampled; and conſidering the ſupernatural abilities it pleaſed God to confer upon the firſt Preachers, it might be expected that their Doctrin ſhould make a greater progreſs, than thoſe that come recommended only by ordinary and human means of perſwaſion. Yet if we take Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi>'s reckoning of Chriſtians for the three firſt ages, and compare it with the growth of Sects among our ſelves within this laſt age; we muſt conclude, that there is ſcarce a Sect within our remembrance, which has not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to time and place, made much better progreſs than the Chriſtian Religion ever did. Since in the greateſt Cities there are few Sects but make ſeveral Aſſemblies for Worſhip; tho' the greateſt Cities with us, are much inferior to the greateſt in ancient times. And if the <hi>Quakers,</hi> a Sect ſcarce forty years ſtanding in the World, are yet grown ſo numerous, that in <hi>London</hi> they have ſeveral places for meeting; it would ſeem to be a ſtrange and incredible diſparagement to the Chriſtian Religion, not to have prevailed ſo much in <hi>Rome</hi> for the ſpace of three hundred years, tho' St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached there for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, and there was a flouriſhing Church before he was brought thither.

                  <hi>As to the other, how to compute the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Roman Church by the number of the poor, I know no better way than to obſerve what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion there was betwixt theſe in other places.</hi> But the ground of this exception is a miſtake: For <hi>Cornelius</hi> does not ſay, that the number of all the poor Chriſtians in <hi>Rome</hi> was but fifteen hundred; but that ſo many were maintained by the publick ſtock of the Church, beſides the neceſſary Officers. Now there might be many more poor maintained, ſome by Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, others by private Charities; and it is plain from the account that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> gives of the poor of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the number in the Church-Book, that thoſe that were maintained by the Church, were but a ſmall part in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the whole number of the poor. For exhorting the rich men to contribute towards the maintenance of the poor, he obſerves how eaſy it would be to provide for them. <hi>For the Church,</hi> ſays he<note n="(t)" place="bottom">Chryſ Hom. 66. in Matth. p. 421. 422.</note> maintains many Widows, and Virgins, and Priſoners, and Sick, and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: the number of thoſe upon the role main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the publick ſtock of the Church, is about three thouſand. Now the income of the Church is ſcarce equal to one of the loweſt of thoſe accounted rich. If therefore but ten
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:95441:188"/>
ſuch rich men would diſpoſe of their Eſtates, as the Church does, there would not be a poor man in all <hi>Antioch</hi> unprovided: Nay, if all the rich men would but give a tenth part to Charity, it would anſwer all occaſions. So that upon the computation of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> the Church did not relieve above a tenth part of the poor. And yet this muſt be more in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion than the Roman Church can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed able to do in <hi>Cornelius</hi> his time, when it had no other revenue than the oblations of the Faithful; whereas in <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, it was endowed with great poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and was maintained from the rents or product of her Eſtate; the Capital remaining undiminiſhed, as he obſerves in the ſame place.</p>
               <p>Our Author having laid this falſe foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proceeds to build upon it in this manner, That at <hi>Conſtantinople, Chryſoſtom</hi> computes <hi>the poor to have been half as many as all the other Chriſtians there. At</hi> Antioch <hi>the ſame Father ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the poor a tenth part.</hi> The firſt is unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and without example in any City: the latter multiplies the poor that ſtand in need of relief, I think, beyond what we can find in any rich City, ſuch as <hi>Antioch</hi> was; yet upon this foot let us reckon. The fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Roman poor we will ſuppoſe, according to <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> to be the tenth part of the poor Chriſtians of the place. The ſum will be fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand. Theſe multiplied by ten, will make an hundred and fifty thouſand. And this may be ſuppoſed about a ſeventh part of the inhabitants in <hi>Rome</hi> of all ages and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:95441:188"/>
And conſidering the great oſtentation, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> makes of the numbers of the Chriſtians in the beginning of this age, and the great increaſe they received in the time intervening between <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> under <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> and <hi>Philip;</hi> I cannot but think I ſet their proportion too low, when I reckon them but a ſeventh part. I cannot paſs by one paſſage in the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Chryſostom,</hi> that I cannot reconcile with his ſuppoſition, that makes the poor of <hi>Antioch</hi> the tenth part of the City. When he had divided the people into ten parts, he makes one to conſiſt of rich Men, another of very poor Men, the other eight to conſiſt of ſuch as had competence of eſtate, and were neither very rich nor very poor. Yet having made this diſtribution, he ſays, that if the poor were divided between thoſe who were rich, and thoſe who were not poor, there would not one poor Man fall to the ſhare of fifty or a hundred: whereas according to his diſtribution, there will be a poor Man left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween nine. I cannot think <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle skilled in Arithmetick, as to commit a miſtake in ſo obvious a reckoning. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuſpect the reading in this place of the <hi>tenth part,</hi> which with ſmall variation, may be reconciled with the following computations.

the people in the great Church before it was dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, makes this part of his defence, That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Paſcal Solemnity was ſo great, that if they had met in ſeveral aſſemblies, the other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were ſo little and ſtreight, that they would have been in danger of ſuffering by the crowd.—And it was better for the whole multitude to meet in that great Church, being a place large enough to receive them all together.</hi> This paſſage hath been often urged and anſwered by ſeveral hands; ſo that I might ſpare my ſelf the labour of any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reply, than referring to thoſe books in which it has been examined; eſpecially ſince our Author has thought fit to add nothing new, but words of aſſurance and oſtentation, that <hi>it is evident beyond contradiction,</hi> and to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of nothing that hath been offered to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach this irrefragable evidence.

And firſt, tho' it ſhould be yeilded to our Author, that it is certain from this paſſage, that all the Chriſtians in <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> were preſent in this aſſembly; yet will it not be of that ſervice to his notion, as he might imagin. Suppoſe then the flock of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> reduced ſo low, that one great Church might receive it all. If this ſhould proceed from ſome late accident, and be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch ſeparations as had been lately made from the Communion of the Church; it can be of no uſe, either for the proving of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Epiſcopacy in elder times, or for the diſcovering of the proportion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in other Cities.

So that our Author, while he leſſens the Catholicks of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> does unawares make the <hi>Arrians</hi> not a Congregation, but a Dioceſe. Nor is it any advantage to the Congregational fancy, to ſtreighten the Catholick Chriſtians within the walls of one Church, while his indulgence to other Chriſtian Sects permits them to increaſe beyond his Rule, and to grow up into a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan ſtature.</p>
               <p>Having conſidered the conſequence of this paſſage of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> upon a kind ſuppoſition, that it proved the thing for which it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; I proceed to ſhew, that this Teſtimony does not certainly evince, that the Chriſtians of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Communion were no more than could meet, or actually aſſembled in that great Church. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
                  <note n="(e)" place="bottom">Ch. Hiſt. p. 10.</note> is not ſo rigid in his inference from this Teſtimony, as to contend, that every Chriſtian of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was preſent in that aſſembly. <hi>I do not hence

gather,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that every man woman and child was preſent.</hi> And to him this only <hi>ſeemeth hence plain—that</hi> the <hi>main body</hi> of them <hi>could</hi> meet <hi>and hear in one aſſembly.</hi> But all things are not equally plain to all people. For if all the other Churches in <hi>Alexandria</hi> could not receive this Congregation, I am afraid they could not all hear, unleſs it were the <hi>Amen,</hi> which they all pronounced aloud; and that indeed might be heard from far. For in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> beſides this great Church, <hi>Epiphanius</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> names nine more; and adds, that there are other Churches beſides, which he had probably named with the reſt, if they had been but few. Nor can they well be conceived much fewer than twenty; for in <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <note n="(g)" place="bottom">Optat. l. 2.</note> there were above forty in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s reign. Suppoſe then a Congregation, that twelve Churches could not contain, which though much inferiour to this new Cathedral, yet had ſome of them ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Biſhop of the greateſt City in the world after <hi>Rome</hi> and his Congregation: It will be ſcarce poſſible, to conceive how all that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhould hear; eſpecially ſince I do not find, that in thoſe days any Church had ſcaffolds, or galleries; but all the people ſtood in the <hi>Area,</hi> and nothing raiſed above the floor, but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Presbyters ſeats, and ſuch places from whence any of the Church Officers ſpoke or read to the people. It is not therefore ſo plain
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:95441:192"/>
as it ſeemed to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that all could hear in ſuch an aſſembly as this.</p>
               <p>Now where a multitude is ſo numerous, that the greater part cannot be partakers of the ſervice for which they are aſſembled, it ſeems to be no longer one Congregation, ſince it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain that purpoſe which brings them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And therefore is a Congregation for ſhew and ſolemnity, and not for edification and religious ſervice. Nor can any bounds be aſſigned to ſuch an Aſſembly; for a Nation may be brought together in that manner. And therefore when a multitude, though crowded together in one place, becomes uncapable of attaining the end of Religious Aſſemblies, it has out-grown the Congregational ſtandard, as much as if it were diſperſed in forty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant places. At a Coronation, all the people in Weſtminſter Abby may be thought but one Congregation; yet the greateſt part hear no more of what is ſaid, than thoſe who are ten miles off. They may joyn in one common acclamation, as that <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Aſſembly did in an <hi>Amen;</hi> ſo they might though they were twenty times as many. So that ſuch a notion of a Congregation runs on to infinite. And that of which we are ſpeaking, being in all probability of this ſort, it exceeded the bounds of the pretended Primitive Epiſcopacy, and is of no uſe in the preſent queſtion.</p>
               <p>However <hi>the whole multitude met in the great Church,</hi> which was <hi>large enough to receive them all.</hi> But what multitude? all the Chriſtians of the City? No, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not ſay that. Or all that were willing, or had opportunity to <pb n="350" facs="tcp:95441:193"/>
attend the publick devotions of the day? <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> ſays not that neither; but that there was ſo great confluence, that the Pariſh-Churches could not hold them. But there was no other Congregation of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Communion in <hi>Alexandria</hi> on that Eaſter-day, beſide this great one; <hi>for the univerſal Harmony and Concurrence of the people had not been ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, if</hi>

                  <hi>they had met in parcels;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were no ſuch meetings.

Nothing he ſays can be extended ſo far, or made to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any more than the multitude aſſembled at that time, with intention to be preſent with the Biſhop. This is <hi>all the people,</hi> and <hi>all the multitude,</hi> that he mentions in this part of his defence. But theſe were all his flock; for <hi>univerſal Harmony of all the people was viſible.</hi> This may be ſaid of any general Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aſſembled from all parts, though all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, nor perhaps half of them do not appear.

               <p>Now to make up this image of Chriſtian unity, it was not neceſſary all the people of the City ſhould flow to the Biſhops Church; but only that the Congregation ſhould be very great, though not ſo as to exclude all others. Notwithſtanding this expreſſion, there might be ſeveral other Aſſemblies in that City at the ſame time. Nor was it otherwiſe at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as we may judge by a paſſage in the Biſhops Defence.

Now the Pariſh Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Alexandria</hi> cannot well be ſuppoſed to leave their Churches unſupplied, upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that all the people would aſſemble with the Biſhop; and they could not but know, that his Church could not hold a tenth part of them; for all the Churches in the City could not receive them all, and this new Church, not yet finiſhed or dedicated, they could not think of. Therefore in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:95441:194"/>
they aſſembled their Pariſhes then, as they did on other times; unleſs we may fancy, that on Eaſter they always attended the Biſhop; and ſo for all the Eaſters before this, left much the greateſt part of the people without any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice on that ſolemn time. For but few of them could crowd into the Biſhops Church, before that great one was built; and the number of the Catholick Chriſtians had been greater, than were at this time of which we are ſpeaking. To conclude, all the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion were not preſent with their Biſhop in the new Church. Thoſe that came, made a very great multitude, and ſuch as the other Churches could not hold, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had each a Congregation already. Theſe could not be diſperſed in the other Churches without danger. Theſe were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to repreſent Catholick unity; and in ſhort, were a Congregation ſuitable to the time, though it might not comprehend all the Chriſtians of that great City.</p>
               <p>Our Author goes on to prove the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> no more than could meet in one Congregation.<note n="(m)" place="bottom">Prim. ep. p. 98.</note> 
                  <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour of <hi>Athanaſius, aſſembled the whole multitude in the Church called</hi> Theonas, <hi>the other Churches being all ſtrait and little.</hi> But ſtill this multitude is not ſaid to be the <hi>whole</hi> of the <hi>Alexandrine</hi> Church, but only of the Biſhops Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

greateſt Cities for ſo many Ages, had no more Chriſtians than might joyn with the Biſhop in one Aſſembly, he falls ſhort of the main point, which is not, whether the Biſhop had more Congregations than one in the place of his Reſidence, but whether in his whole Dioceſe he had no more. I know ſome Biſhops who reſide in places, that can ſcarce furniſh a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Congregation, and yet have more than a hundred within their Dioceſe. And in ſome of our Cities I make no doubt, but the whole people, making common allowance for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Abſents, might be contained within the walls of the Cathedral; yet this is but a ſmall part of the Biſhops flock. If therefore in ancient times, when Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> fancied there was another ſpecies of Epiſcopacy, the caſe was the ſame, or not very different; all the pains he has beſtowed in the reduction of Cities into a ſingle Congregation, and all the Earthquakes and Peſtilences which he called to his aſſiſtance to leſſen the number of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, might have been ſpared. What Country or Territory the ancient Biſhops had beſides the City where they lived, comes now under examination. And if it ſhall appear by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies unexceptionable, that the ancient Cities had large Territories; and that theſe Territories were under the Biſhop of the City; and that the people there were too numerous, and too far diſtant to be able to come to the Biſhops Church; then I hope, we ſhall be no more troubled with this new way of meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ancient Biſhopricks by the compaſs of the City wall. Here then lies the ſtreſs of the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:95441:203"/>
Queſtion concerning Primitive Epiſcopacy. And I cannot but obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi>'s diligence was not either ſo great in this part, or nothing could be found to give ſo much as a pretence to ſtreighten the bounds of thoſe Territories which were under the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Juriſdiction, no leſs than the City where he lived. Yet ſomething he thinks fit to ſay to this point, which I am now to conſider.</p>

                  <hi>It may be alledged, that not only the City and (but) a large Territory belonging to it, and the Villages therein made up the Biſhops Dioceſe.</hi> Anſw. <hi>If the Chriſtians in the Villages—increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them—beyond the capacity of perſonal Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it muſt be in the greatest Cities, or elſe no where.</hi> The conſequence is not very evident; for ſome very little Cities had great Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> where <hi>Theodoret</hi> was Biſhop; of which more anon.

The Reader may depend upon it, that there is not the leaſt title either in the Epiſtles, or any Tract of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to that purpoſe: And thoſe

paſſages that he refers to, are only general expreſſions, <hi>all the people, all the Brotherhood,</hi> &amp;c. which have been already conſidered. Nor can it be conceived poſſible; for though we have not the meaſure of all the region belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Carthage,</hi> yet are there ſome hints that are ſufficient to diſprove this. A place ten miles diſtant from that City, was reckoned<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Procop.

The Cities, which the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> divided between the Tribes, when they poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Canaan,</hi> were above twenty times as many as they had under that title in our Saviour's time. For in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time it ſeems every ſmall Town paſſed for a City; but in that of our Saviour it was otherwiſe. And as the Cities were then greater, and leſs numerous, ſo was their Territory proportionably more large; at leaſtwiſe in the ſenſe of the preſent Queſtion. That ſome Cities of the <hi>Levites</hi> were <hi>Royal,</hi> is not to the purpoſe; for if they were all to have the ſame meaſure of Suburbs, according to that <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>

In ſhort, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral notion of the thing does not admit the narrowneſs of Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi>'s conceit; and the word it ſelf ſpeaks ſomething that is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the greatneſs and diſtinction of a City.</p>
               <p>The difference between the conſtitution of ancient Cities, and thoſe of later ages in this part of the world will appear; if we conſider firſt, that they were greater communities, not confined within the walls of one Town, but ſtretched over all the adjacent Country. For the Juriſdiction of the City Magiſtrate reached as far as the community; for the City was the head and ſupream part of it, all the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates within the Territory being ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.

were proprietors of that Territory, who commonly lived in the City, and left the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages to their Slaves, or to ſuch Country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were in the nature of Tenants under a ſervile Tenure. The title was in the City, though particular Citizens had the poſſeſſion; nor could any, as I think, have a right to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs any eſtate in that Territory, who was not firſt free of the City. The greater Villages, which anſwer our Burroughs, had Magiſtrates of their own, but ſubordinate to thoſe of the City, and generally choſe by the City; as <hi>Frontinus</hi>
                  <note n="(t)" place="bottom">Frontin. de limit. Agr. p. 57.</note> informs us; and I think I have obſerved already upon another occaſion. And laſtly the ancient Cities were greater in their deſign, which was generally military; and there was ſcarce any ſo mean, that had not ſome proviſion for war. The Greek Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the midſt of barbarous Nations, were like ſo many Camps; and the Romans filled all their conqueſts with Cities of their own people, with a deſign of ſecuring the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries they had ſubdued. Now as it is natural to all things to beget after their own likeneſs; ſo the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> did in this reſpect. For <hi>Greece</hi> conſiſting of many Cities inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, propagated their kind, as far as their Arms or their Ships carried them. And <hi>Rome</hi> from a ſmall City, becoming miſtreſs of a great part of the world, planted every where little models of it ſelf; and ſhared the world between its Colonies, as ſo many children.
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:95441:215"/>
And where they could not fill all the Country, they preſerved ſuch Cities as they found, and every where encouraged the people by their example, to form themſelves into ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities. So that generally ſpeaking, all the Roman dominion was parcelled out into Cities and Territories that belonged to them; whole Provinces were effectually repreſented by the Deputies of the Cities of it. And though in ſome places there might be exempts, yet in general thus the Roman Dominion was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted.</p>
               <p>Upon this conſtitution Chriſtianity was ſuperinduced, and the Churches of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many communities, and having ſome reſemblance to Cities, ſo far as to take their name from the civil aſſemblies, grew up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſhape of thoſe civil communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in which they were planted, and had the ſame common bounds and meaſure with them. So that when the whole lump was leavened, and all the people were reduced to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith; the Church and the City in reſpect of their matter were the ſame. The rules indeed and the ends of the City of man and the City of God, were very different, and ſtood as wide aſunder, as Heaven is from the Earth; but the ſame people were both the Citizens and the Chriſtians. The Church and the City had one and the ſame Territory; and as far as the Juriſdiction of the civil Magiſtrate reached, ſo far was the Dioceſe of the Biſhop extended. Our Saviour having left no rule about limits, the Apoſtles made no new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributions, but followed the form of the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:95441:216"/>
Empire, planting in every City a compleat and entire Church, that conſiſted not only of the Inhabitants of the City, but of the Region belonging to it. If any were converted, and if their diſtance or number made them inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of repairing to the City-Church upon all their Religious occaſions, they had Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations apart, and ſubordinate Officers to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them, as it was in the civil diſpoſition; our Saviour having appointed ſeveral Orders in his Church, and the Apoſtles propagating thoſe, and appointing ſome new, as occaſion required. Only, as in greater cauſes, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people ſued in the City Courts; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in ſuch cauſes of Religion, that concerned the whole community, ſuch as that of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and turning out of the communion, the Chriſtians of the Territory were under the authority of the City-Church.

               <p>To make this matter yet more clear, I will inſtance in ſome Biſhopricks whoſe extent are known, or ſo much at leaſtwiſe, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers them to be Dioceſes conſiſting of many Country Pariſhes, beſides the City Churches. I will begin with the Biſhoprick of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> becauſe the limits of it have been deſcribed with greateſt exactneſs and particularity. The Dioceſe of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was forty miles in length, and as much in breadth: And <hi>Theodoret</hi>
                  <note n="(h)" place="bottom">Theod. ep. 42.</note> proceeds to deſcribe it ſo minutely, that he ſets down the number of acres, together with the condition and tenure of the land. There were fifty thouſand free from any ſervice, ten thouſand belonging to the Fiſc, about fifteen thouſand more ſubject to taxes, but unable to pay according to the proportion then ſet. So that this inſtance ſeems clear beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. And as to the Eccleſiaſtical ſtate of this Territory, in his Epiſtle to <hi>Leo</hi> he ſays,<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Theod. ep. 113.</note> there were eight hundred Churches in it, all belonging to his care.

               <p>In the middle of the fifth Century, Biſhops were grown much more numerous than in the fore-going Ages; and therefore their Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks were of leſs extent. Yet then in many Provinces of the Empire the Dioceſes were very large, which we may learn, by compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the number of the Biſhops in ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, with the meaſure of the Country. <hi>Labbe</hi> the Jeſuit has publiſhed an ancient Copy of the ſubſcriptions of the Council of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> which he found among the Papers of <hi>Simond.</hi> In that Copy, the ſubſcribing Biſhops are digeſted according to their Provinces, and the Metropolitans ſet down the names of all that were abſent. So that in ſeveral Provinces we have the whole number of Biſhops. And within a few years after this Council, we have the Synodical Epiſtles of many plenary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:95441:224"/>
Councils. If therefore we can have any certainty concerning the limits of thoſe Countries, we may eaſily find out a common meaſure for the Dioceſes. I have already ſhewed how large the Dioceſes of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this foot; and I have occaſionally mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Crete,</hi> the Circuit of the Iſland being known and the number of their Biſhops. <hi>Cyprus</hi> too hath been computed, but it was by the <hi>Notitia</hi> of <hi>Leo,</hi> which hath three Biſhopricks more than were in the time of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> for then all the Biſhops of that Iſland were but ten, of whom ſix were preſent at the Council, and three abſent. Yet about this time did <hi>Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> live, who obſerved, that in <hi>Cyprus</hi> there were Biſhops in Villages.</p>
               <p>Where nature hath made the bounds of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, they remain always the ſame; and a computation of the largeneſs of Dioceſes in ſuch places from the number of them will be certain. But where limits are arbitrary, and depend only upon the agreement of men, they are frequently changed: and a Country may ſtill retain the ſame name, though the limits have been often altered. However in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent queſtion, which does not require exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we have ſuch notices of the diſtance of places left in ancient deſcriptions, as give ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence of the greatneſs of ancient Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes in many Countries.

I know that <hi>Aſia</hi> ſignifies very ambiguouſly, and takes in ſometimes more and ſometimes fewer Countries; but that does not concern the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent queſtion; for the ſubſcriptions of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> do ſufficiently diſcover the extent of this Province.

and the line wants not much of two hundred Miles, comprehending all <hi>Jonia</hi> and <hi>Aeolis,</hi> and all North to <hi>Troas.</hi> But then it muſt be conſidered, that this Country conſiſts of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of large <hi>Peninſulae,</hi> which adds much to the content. For inſtance, from <hi>Epheſus</hi> to <hi>Smyrna</hi> in a direct line is but forty Miles; but by Sea round the <hi>Peninſula,</hi> and coaſting from Town to Town, it is two hundred and ſeventy five.

                  <note n="(y)" place="bottom">Conc. Chalced. Act. 6.</note> and the two and twenty who were abſent, ſubſcribed by their Metropolitan. In ſo large a Country, and ſo full of Cities and People, it would be ſomething difficult to diſpoſe of them all in forty Congregations.</p>
               <p>But the extent of ancient Dioceſes remains ſtill viſible in <hi>France.

he ſhould keep to the ancient <hi>Notitia</hi> of the Roman Empire. All that he obſerved<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Id. p. 29.</note> of alteration, was only the new Biſhopricks. But theſe cannot be any hindrance, as long as it is known from what Dioceſes thoſe new Biſhopricks were taken; for the old Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes were ſo much the leſs. It is well known the Dioceſes of <hi>France</hi> are not like our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes; and yet the greateſt part of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as they were thirteen hundred years ago. And here Learned Men think<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Si uſpiam alibi in Gallia cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te videre licet, Provincias &amp; Diaeceſes Epiſcopales — per Chriſtianos primum inſtitut. Marg. Not. ep. p. 10.</note> the Dioceſes have the ſame bounds they had when they were firſt ſet by the Chriſtians, according to the Diſpoſition of the Empire. Thoſe that are the ſmalleſt, in that Kingdom, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the lateſt. For in the firſt <hi>Aquitain</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Pap. Maſſon. Not. ep. Franc. ap. Ducheſn. T. 1. p. 57.</note> there were four new Biſhopricks erected by Pope <hi>John</hi> XXII. taken from the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cities. In the ſecond <hi>Aquitain,</hi> the ſame Pope made<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Id. p. 61.</note> the ſame number. In the Dioceſe of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> he erected ſix. So that contrary to Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi>'s notion, the old Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes are ſtill the largeſt, and the new Papal erections draw neareſt to his Congregational way; as is evident in this Country of which I am ſpeaking, as well as in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Eaſt and Weſt of <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> notes, have retained their Biſhopricks in their ancient
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:95441:227"/>
form, and there they are the moſt unlike our Pariſhes and the imagination of Mr. <hi>Clerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> So it is needleſs to go to <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> to look for the bounds of ancient Dioceſes which have been loſt ſo long ago; when we have ſo clear and full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence nearer home. Yet theſe Biſhopricks of <hi>France,</hi> as large as they ſeem to be, are much leſs than they were in the Primitive ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Constantine;</hi> if we may depend upon the opinion of a very Learned Man,<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Potuerunt ab initio binae civitates, ab uno regi Pontifice, &amp;c. Bucher. Belg. Rom. l. 8. c. 15.</note> and a good Judg of ſuch matters. For before <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantin</hi>'s time, ſays <hi>Bucherius,</hi> altho there were many Chriſtians in <hi>Gaule,</hi> there were but few Biſhops; for it is poſſible that two Cities might be under one Biſhop, as afterwards <hi>Bologne</hi> and <hi>Teroanne, Cambray</hi> and <hi>Arras, Tournay</hi> and <hi>Noyon,</hi> had but one Biſhop for two Cities. For as it is certain, that ſome Cities in that Country had Biſhops before <hi>Conſtantin</hi>'s times; ſo it is as certain, that ſeveral had none till the time of his Sons. This was the caſe of <hi>Angier,</hi> and ſome other places mentioned in the ſame Author, which he proves by the number of Succeſſions. For inſtance, <hi>Defenſor,</hi> who was one of the Ordainers of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> was the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Angier.</hi> There were but ten Biſhops of <hi>Vermand</hi> before <hi>Sophronius,</hi> who ſubſcribed in the Synod of <hi>Orleans</hi> Anno 511. And <hi>Silvanus</hi> was but the ninth Biſhop
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:95441:228"/>
of <hi>Senlis,</hi> who was alſo preſent at the ſame Synod. And the ſame Author proves<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Buch. Belg. Rom. l. 8. c. 10.</note> that in the two <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces the Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks preſerved the ſame bounds from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>'s time to the laſt age, when <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth erected new Seas; and certainly there are few places in the World, where there were longer Biſhopricks.</p>
               <p>It is evident beyond all reaſonable doubt, that the number of Biſhops in the three firſt ages was far leſs than in thoſe that followed. Nor have I met with any who called this in queſtion, but Mr. <hi>Seldon.</hi> He indeed being in great diſtreſs for his <hi>Arabian Fabler,</hi> who brings above two thouſand Biſhops to the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to ſave the credit of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, ſuggeſts,<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Selden in Eutych Orig. p. 83. 84. 85.</note> that in <hi>Conſtantin</hi>'s time; and before, Dioceſes had other bounds, and Biſhopricks were more numerous and of leſs extent, than in the ſucceeding ages, when Chriſtianity was eſtabliſhed by Law. That the bounds of ancient Biſhopricks are altogether unknown, and thoſe which follow the civil diſtribution of the Provinces of the Empire, are new. He mentions and recommends <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius</hi> and <hi>Salmaſius</hi> concerning the <hi>Suburbicary Regions</hi> upon this occaſion; but I do not find they have any thing to his purpoſe, or that they were of his opinion. It is ſtrange a perſon of ſo great reading ſhould advance a notion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:95441:228"/>
ancient times, againſt the general o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Learned Men, without any teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from Antiquity to give it countenance; eſpecially when there are ſo many things in the Writers of the third and fourth Centuries, that ſeem to overthrow it. What! did not the Church before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> follow the civil diſpoſition? How then came the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to have juriſdiction over <hi>Egypt, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> ſo long before the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> for there it was confirmed as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and immemorial Cuſtom? How came the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to challenge the <hi>Suburbicary Regions</hi> by the ſame preſcription? And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, How came <hi>Cyprian</hi> to preſide in the general or provincial Synods of <hi>Africk,</hi> but in the right of his City? He was not long a Biſhop, and could not preſide by his Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, which in the other Provinces of <hi>Africk</hi> took place after the rights of Metropolitans had been ſetled in all the other parts of the Empire. How came <hi>Cornelius</hi> to aſſemble the Biſhops of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to preſide when he was ſo young a Biſhop, but by the preheminence of his City? Theſe things are ſo obvious, that they cannot be avoided. As to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Biſhopricks, what can be more plain, than that they were generally according to the number of Cities? Thoſe Provinces which had moſt Cities, had moſt Biſhops. But in the general, it is evident that the number of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks was much leſs before <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> than ſince. <hi>Africa</hi> makes this clear beyond contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and whoever compares either the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial or general Synods of that Country in
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:95441:229"/>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, with thoſe that followed in the next age, will quickly be convinced. The general Synod under <hi>Cyprian,</hi> concerning the Rebaptizing of Hereticks, had but eighty ſeven Biſhops, of whom there were four ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed from the Province of <hi>Tripolis,</hi> two preſent, and two by proxy, who in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability were all of the Province; which in the next age, when Biſhops were multiplied every where elſe in <hi>Africk</hi> beyond all example, had but one more; and it cannot be well doubted, but other Provinces ſent in the ſame proportion. For this was one of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; and is ſpared by following Synods upon that account, as to the number it is to ſend to Synods. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> in the middle of the fourth Century, affirms, that <hi>Mareotes,</hi> a large Region belonging to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> never had a Biſhop, but always belonged to the Biſhop of the City. Why? but becauſe it was part of its Territory? So this fancy of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> is diſproved by undoubted Evidence; and the contrary is too plain to be diſputed.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians in the firſt three ages were diſperſed over the Empire, ſo that there was hardly a Town where there were not ſome; and thoſe, if they had no Biſhop, had a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter or a Deacon for Divine Service. Now the fewer Biſhops are found in thoſe times, the more of theſe Subordinate Officers muſt be acknowledged. Of theſe there was not one independent from ſome Biſhop; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fewer Biſhops, the more Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they muſt have under their inſpection. And therefore if we compare the account
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:95441:229"/>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> gives of the number of the Chriſtians, and their diſperſion in all manner of places; we muſt conclude the Dioceſes of the firſt ages to be larger than of thoſe that ſucceeded, if not for multitude, at leaſtwiſe for extent and number of ſmaller Congregations. In the fourth and fifth Centuries we read of many new Biſhopricks erected; but of no old ones united or ſunk: And thoſe Canons, which forbid the making of Biſhops in Villages, do expreſly except thoſe where there had been any before. So that by the rules of theſe ages in which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſuppoſes an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the number of the old Biſhopricks could not be diminiſhed; and it is plain by many inſtances, that they were encreaſed.</p>
               <p>Nor could this pretended change of the bounds of Dioceſes in the fourth Century be made without great clamour and diſturbance: for there never was an age of greater ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity among Chriſtians; the parties were very watchful, and cried out upon every the leaſt Innovation. What complaints muſt we have heard, if all the Dioceſes in the Empire muſt have been caſt, as it were, in a new mold; and ſo many by this reduction muſt have loſt either the whole, or part of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks? If any thing of this nature had been ſo much as attempted; it is impoſſible but ſome account muſt have been left of it, by an age ſo much abounding in Writers.</p>
               <p>However it is ſufficient for our preſent purpoſe, that the Biſhops of the firſt ages were Dioceſans, and had many of them more Congregations than one within their Dioceſes.

                  <hi>that the Apoſtles deſigned there ſhould be ſuch Biſhops, as they inſtituted, in Country Towns, and not in Cities only.</hi> If he means by <hi>ſuch Biſhops,</hi> Presbyters only; then indeed not only every Church, but every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation required ſuch; but the Biſhops of the Apoſtles Ordination had the care of many Congregations. And it is plain in Scripture, that ſuch general Officers they did appoint, and they themſelves were of that kind. <hi>Some Prelatists,</hi> he obſerves, <hi>will have Biſhop and City to be adequate;</hi> but he will have it, <hi>that Church and Biſhop ſhould be ſo; for it is not the <pb n="426" facs="tcp:95441:233"/>
City,</hi> as ſuch, <hi>requires a Biſhop, but becauſe it had a Church in it.</hi> It is true; but the narrowneſs of the Independent ſpirit confounds a Church with a Congregation.

Where therefore there was one competent Church, there was a Biſhop; but this might conſiſt of ſeveral Congregations. The Church of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> may be ſtill mentioned to this purpoſe, after all Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi>'s attempts to diminiſh it. The number of Converts there was too great for one Congregation,<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Acts 11.22.</note> yet they all made but one Church; and ſo it was where ever Chriſtians increaſed in the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore I hope to be excuſed, if in this caſe I take the practice of the Apoſtles and of the Church in ſucceeding ages, to be ſafer Interpreters of their deſign, than the novel conjectures of men addicted to ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity. The inſtance of <hi>Majuma</hi> the Port of <hi>Gaza,</hi> is directly againſt the purpoſe for which it is brought; for it had no Biſhop till it was a City. And one thing in this citation of Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> concerning it, deſerves to be noted. For where <hi>Sozomen</hi> ſays, that the bounds of each Dioceſe were appointed, and what <hi>Altars</hi> ſhould belong to each; our Author thought fit to change the number, and to write
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:95441:233"/>
                  <hi>diſtinct Altar,</hi> as agreeing better with his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though this way does not agree well with common honeſty and good faith. The weak objection which he makes for Epiſcopal men, and the ſuitable anſwer he returns to it, are not worth notice. For here he ſpeaks only to himſelf; and I do not wonder he ſhould argue ſo weakly for us, when his arguments againſt us are ſo harmleſs. So the Mother of <hi>Siſera</hi> and her wiſe Ladies, did doubt and reply, and fancy Triumphs, when the day was loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The difference between the modern and ancient models is apparent,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> thinks, <hi>in</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland <hi>and</hi> Ireland. The <hi>ancient model</hi> of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy in <hi>England</hi> is ſomething hard to find. For the <hi>Saxons</hi> being Pagans, when they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued this Country, and driving the old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants into the remote corners of it; all the bounds of civil and Eccleſiaſtical Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction within this Kingdom were loſt. But the model he ſpeaks of, is that of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, who had no more deſign to plant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Epiſcopacy in <hi>England,</hi> than he had to make it Independent. He intended twelve Biſhops for the Province of <hi>York,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> obſerves; but that might have been done, and the Dioceſes be large enough. For that Province then reached from <hi>Humbre</hi> to the Frith of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and about the year 681. had five Biſhops (however Mr. <hi>Clerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> affirms, that for many ages it had no more than three) and every one of them had Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes of very great extent. Thoſe in the South were not all ſo great, but yet compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

many Congregations; and ſome of them [as <hi>Canterbury, London</hi> and <hi>Rochester</hi>] do remain ſtill under the ſame limits that were at firſt appointed them by <hi>Auguſtin</hi> the Archbiſhop. How they ſtood before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> is now beyond all memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and there is little hope left of making any new diſcovery in this matter, which hath been treated by ſo many great men, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent inquirers into the Antiquities of their Country. <hi>Marcianus Heracleota</hi>
                  <note n="(i)" place="bottom">Peripl. p. 92.</note> reckons fifty nine Cities in <hi>Britain,</hi> which I ſuppoſe he took out of <hi>Ptolomy.</hi>

But it ſeems this number was reduced afterwards. For <hi>Bede</hi>
                  <note n="(m)" place="bottom">Bed. H. E. l. 1. c. 1.</note> mentions but twenty eight, when he would ſet out the moſt flouriſhing condition of this Country in the Roman times. As for the Canon of the Synod of <hi>Herudford</hi> for aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the number of Biſhops, which Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> inſiſts on, there was good reaſon for it. For at that time there were no more than ſeven Biſhops in all the <hi>Saxon</hi> part of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> which then reaching to the Frith of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> was as large as all <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> joyned together are now.</p>

                  <hi>The ancient model</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> is as little known: for the Legends of St. <hi>Patrick</hi> are but ſorry evidence of the ancient ſtate of the Iriſh Church, and that Fable has been already exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. In <hi>Phaenicia</hi> indeed the Latins did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Biſhopricks to a leſſer number in the twelfth Century; becauſe the condition of that Country was much altered, and moſt of the ancient Epiſcopal Cities deſtroyed, or the people Mahometans. But <hi>that it was the humour of that age, inſtead of multiplying to reduce Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks,</hi> is only a fancy of Mr. <hi>Clerkſon.</hi> For I have ſhewed the practice of <hi>Italy</hi> at that time to be quite contrary; where inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, they raiſed a great number of new Biſhopricks, and have been increaſing of them ever ſince. Nor does it ſerve to any purpoſe to produce the Patriarchat of <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in the time of the <hi>Latins,</hi> from what it had been anciently; ſince the condition of thoſe Countries had been much altered, and the Chriſtians were reduced to a very ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber under the long and heavy Tyranny of the <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> beſtows a whole Chapter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his notion of the ſmallneſs of ancient Biſhopricks, by repeating thoſe obſervations he had already made: That all the people ſhould be preſent at the election of Biſhops; that the Biſhop was to examine the ſtate of the Penitents; that he was to preach to all the Brethren; that there was but one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion table in a Dioceſe. All theſe have been anſwered already; and it is evident by many inſtances, as well as the neceſſity of the thing
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:95441:235"/>
it ſelf, that the Chriſtians of the Country had diſtinct Congregations, and ſetled Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to attend them, all in ſubordination to the City Biſhop; that their Sacraments of Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper were admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred there by thoſe Presbyters; that, as for Diſcipline and Confirmation, the Biſhop viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe places in perſon; that thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations were not obliged to repair to the City-Church, ſo much as on Eaſter or the moſt ſolemn Feſtivals. Theſe things are as plain as words can expreſs. <hi>Athanaſius, Baſil, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> and ſeveral others give an account of their viſitations. And <hi>Jerom</hi>
                  <note n="(n)" place="bottom">Hieron. Cont.

               <p>There is nothing more precarious, and more deſtitute of the appearance of truth, than the deduction our Author makes of the progreſs of Dioceſan Epiſcopacy, and the riſe of it, from the deſtruction of the Congregational model.<note n="(o)" place="bottom">Prim. ep. p. 191.</note> 
                  <hi>A Biſhop of a Country Pariſh would be ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get another Pariſh under him. The third Council of</hi> Carthage, Can. 46. <hi>takes notice of ſuch Biſhops.</hi> Nothing can be more directly againſt his purpoſe than that Canon; by which it appears, that ſuch Country places as had Biſhops, were of new erection; that they had

So that the deſign of Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> is defeated by his own evidence. For whereas he would ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, that Dioceſes did riſe by the incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Biſhop of one Pariſh upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by joyning Pariſh to Pariſh: The quite contrary appears from the place alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that the Biſhop of one Pariſh, as he calls him, was raiſed by crumbling of ancient Dioceſes; and that the other Pariſh, which he is ſaid to challenge, was not ſuch a one as had a Pariſh Biſhop to it ſelf, but was part of a Dioceſe conſiſting of many ſuch; and that this large Biſhoprick was the ancient, the ſmall an innovation. I perceive that conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence does not always operate alike in thoſe who pretend ſo great niceneſs. For while they take offence and ſtart at a trifle, they make no ſcruple of ſins of unfaithfulneſs; and repreſent that as truth and reality, which in their own conſcience they know to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>

                  <hi>When a Biſhop had part of a City, he was unſatisfied till he had got the whole. Thus</hi> Flavianus <hi>at</hi> Antioch <hi>would not ſuffer a Biſhop to be made to

ſucceed</hi> Evagrius, <hi>that he might have the City in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to himſelf.</hi> One may be apt to imagine, that in ancient time <hi>Antioch</hi> was divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween many Biſhops, and that this <hi>Flavianus</hi> was the firſt ambitious man, who would have the City entire to himſelf. Whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Schiſms that diſtracted the Church of that place, the City had ever had but one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. But the <hi>Arrians</hi> having the poſſeſſion of the publick Churches, and being eſtabliſhed there by authority, the Catholick Party which was very low there at that time, happened<note n="(r)" place="bottom">Socr. l. 3. c. 6. 9.

This being againſt the rule and conſtant practice of the Church, it was agreed to put an end to this irregularity, by uniting all, when one ſhould die, under the Survivor. <hi>Flavianus</hi> broke this agreement; for when <hi>Meletius</hi> died, he procured himſelf to be made Biſhop in his ſtead, againſt <hi>Paulinus</hi> who was the Survivor. And he likewiſe dying, his party choſe <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Flavianus;</hi> who when that Competitor was dead, endeavoured to hinder the ordination of a ſucceſſour. And this is the ſtory, which Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> thinks fit to bring as a proof, <hi>how a Biſhop of a part of a City was unſatisfied till he had the whole;</hi> as if it were the rule or allowed pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the ancient Church, to divide a City between many Biſhops.</p>

the Dioceſe of <hi>Antioch,</hi> than which there were few greater in the world, and receiving the orders of Deacon and Presbyter in that Church. Afterwards removed from thence to be Biſhop of the Imperial City; having ſo many Congregations in the City, ſo many Pariſhes in the Country, ſuch a number of Provinces under his Juriſdiction, as made the better part of the Eaſtern Empire: Does he <hi>expreſs his conſcience</hi> againſt <hi>a very large Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick?</hi> Surely a perſon of ſo exalted eloquence could not be guilty of ſuch a ſoleciſm; his Chair would have born teſtimony againſt him, and refuted all his Sermon. If this was his conſcience, why did he not divide? Why did he not appoint one Biſhop in <hi>Sycae,</hi> another in <hi>Hestiae,</hi> where <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had built a Church that might have become a Biſhop? Or if theſe places were too near, why did he not erect new Biſhopricks in the remoter part of his Territory, or in his Provinces; ſince as Patriarch, he had ſufficient authority to make what number of Biſhops he pleaſed? He depoſed indeed a great number of unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Biſhops, and ordained others in their places; but there is no account of any new erections of his in Market Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages. And his friends make bold to cenſure <hi>Theophilus,</hi> for making Biſhops in ſmall places, where there had been none before. It is therefore very marvellous, that the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſo great and holy a perſon ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt his own practice, and condemn a large Biſhoprick, while himſelf was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of one of the largeſt in world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

diſcovering the leaſt <hi>deſire</hi> or <hi>endeavour</hi> to part it between ſeveral Congregational Paſtors. As for his <hi>Principles,</hi> he had no other in this matter than the rule and practice of the Church. One City, according to his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, could have but one Biſhop; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſeems to be ſtartled at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s direction, to the Biſhops and Deacons of <hi>Philippi.</hi> What, more Biſhops than one, ſays he, in one City? No, by no means: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he concludes they were received not Biſhops in the ſenſe of the word in his times, but Presbyters only. And therefore according to his principles, if a City were never ſo great, it ought to have but one Biſhop. However let us hear what <hi>Chryſostom</hi> ſays in the places cited by Mr. <hi>Clerkſon.</hi>

                  <hi>what can a multitude avail us? Wilt thou underſtand, that the deſirable multitude are the Holy, not the many?—What care I for the multitude? What advantage is in them?</hi> But here is no compariſon between a great Biſhoprick and a ſmall, as ſuch; but between many bad and few good. And in this caſe <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s judgment cannot be conteſted; it is clear, that we are to go by weight, not by number. The people of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> as they were exceeding numerous, ſo they were very diſſolute; and this holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop flamed againſt the vices of the place, with a zeal becoming his character. He is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent only to reprove and to rebuke with
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:95441:238"/>
authority; but threatens to uſe the utmoſt of his ſpiritual cenſures, againſt thoſe that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced Chriſtianity by their wicked lives. In this Reſolution of reforming his people, he bids defiance to all diſcouragements and oppoſition. Some urged the multitude of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders againſt him, that too rough dealing might drive them to joyn with Sectaries. But this did not at all abate the reſolution of the Biſhop: He ſcorns the multitude upon this account, and cries, <hi>what care I for a multitude?</hi> It was far from his intention to caſt off this multitude, or to divide them into ſeveral diſtinct Congregations under other Biſhops; but his deſign was to reform their lives, and to build up and adorn the Church committed to him <hi>with many that were good, with a multitude not only numerous, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</hi> And for this purpoſe he offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſacrifice, and is content to be cut off, ſo that he might gain many to Chriſt. If <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> had proceeded upon the principles of Mr. <hi>Clerkſon;</hi> he muſt have given his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe another turn, and ſaid, that ſince one Biſhop is not ſufficient for ſo great a people, and a hundred and fifty Perſons are a charge more than one can well diſcharge; it is fit that you chuſe your ſelves Paſtors after your own hearts, and enter into Covenant with them. For this great diſſoluteneſs proceeds from the exceſſive greatneſs of the flock, and the diſproportion that is between it and the ability of a ſingle Shepherd. For this Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan way is an innovation, and raiſed upon the ruin of ancient diſcipline. Wherefore
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:95441:239"/>
ſeparate your ſelves, for I will not undertake the charge of above a hundred and fifty ſouls. To this effect he muſt have <hi>expreſſed his conſcience,</hi> if his principles had been the ſame with Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi>'s. But he on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary lays claim to the whole flock, nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and diſordered as it was; he thought himſelf bound in conſcience to endeavour the reformation of it, and to uſe fullneſs of Epiſcopal authority to reduce them. <hi>He does not complain that they are many, but that they are unprofitable;</hi> would they but reform their lives, let them be as numerous as they pleaſe; for <hi>the greater their number, the greater would be his joy.</hi> So far is <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> from <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his conſcience againſt large Biſhopricks</hi> in the places cited by Mr. <hi>Clerkſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor do his other Arguments drawn out of the Sermons of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> come any thing nearer to the point. <hi>The Epiſcopate,</hi> ſays he,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Prim. ep. p. 203, 204.</note> 
                  <hi>is ſo called from the inſpecting all. He ought to be an Overſeer of all, bearing the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of all; he had need of many thouſand Eyes. —He ought to go the rounds night and day, more than any Commander in an Army. We must give account of all their ſouls, when we have been defective in any thing. I wonder if any Biſhops can ever be ſaved, conſidering the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the threatning, and their negligence.</hi> All this is very true, but not to our Author's purpoſe. Biſhops are certainly accountable
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:95441:239"/>
for thoſe who periſh by their neglect of their proper Office. But then the duty of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral overſeer is not the ſame with that of a ſubordinate Office. A Pariſh Presbyter will not be condemned for not performing the duty of a Maſter of a Family, nor a Biſhop for not doing the office of a Presbyter to all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of his Dioceſe. But theſe words are to be underſtood with analogy to the nature of the Office of which they are ſpoken; but the meaſure of the Office cannot be taken from thoſe expreſſions. A General muſt go the Rounds, and ſo muſt a Biſhop too: But it follows not therefore, that a General ought not to command more Men than a private Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or that a Biſhop ought to have no more Pariſhes than a Presbyter may ſupply.</p>
               <p>What inferences are to be drawn out of this topick concerning the great neſs of the Epiſcopal charge, and the dreadful condition of thoſe who do not faithfully diſcharge it, may better be learned from <hi>Chryſostom</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Chryſ. in Heb. Hom. 34.</note> than Mr. <hi>Clerkſon.</hi> Now ſince the account to be given of that Adminiſtration is ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: He wonders that any ſhould be ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to deſire it. It is ſtrange, that Men ſhould be ſo ambitious of a high ſtation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but withall ſo hazardous; that they ſhould ſollicite, nay, intrude upon ſuch a charge, and reckon it a deſirable promotion to be raiſed to a Precipice, where without the greateſt care and circumſpection in the World
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:95441:240"/>
they muſt fall head-long. And certainly what he ſays to that effect, with a heat and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence inimitable, is ſufficient, one would think, to mortify the moſt impotent Ambition in the World.</p>
               <p>Another inference, which <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> draws from the conſideration of the danger to which the Biſhop's Office does expoſe him, is, that therefore the People under his charge ought to reſpect and to love him: <hi>Knowing then,</hi> ſays he,<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Chryſ. in Joh. Hom. 86.</note> 
                  <hi>the greatneſs of his danger upon your account; You on your part ought proportionably to love and to obſerve him. While the Pilot is encouraged, all is ſafe; but if he be reproached, and hated, and hindred, all is in danger to be loſt. So a Biſhop,</hi> 
                  <q>if reſpected, can go on in the buſineſs of his high and neceſſary Office, with chearfulneſs and comfort: But when he is diſcouraged with the frowardneſs and evil diſpoſition of thoſe under his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his hands are weakned, the People are expoſed to the mercy of the waves.</q> He proceeds farther to ſhew the reſpect due to that Office, even under the ſuppoſition of Mal-Adminiſtration. <q>For our Saviour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the Jews to obſerve the Scribes, becauſe they ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Chair, tho their actions were not ſuitable to the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Station: But the Biſhops have a more honourable Chair, for they ſit in the Chair of Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:95441:240"/>Had the notion of Congregational Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy ever come into the thoughts of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> theſe inferences had been very unſuitable. For then inſtead of adviſing the People to rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and obey their Biſhop, who expoſed his Soul to ſo much danger by taking upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the care of them all, he muſt have adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> and his Brethren would have done, that they would ſeparate from him, for they were too many for the overſight of one Biſhop: He could not Preach to them all: He could not Viſit nor Comfort them all: There were Men of as great gifts willing to receive them in elect Congregations; theſe ſhould look into the inward ſtate of the Soul, and the ſecrets of their Families: As for the Biſhop he had more than he could look well after, and it was not fit that they ſhould ſwell his accounts too high by adding to his charge. If <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> had the ſame thoughts of a large Biſhoprick with Mr. <hi>Clerkſon,</hi> ſuch muſt have been his Diſcourſe. But he was far from chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ancient bounds, or deſiring Biſhops in conſideration of the danger of ſo great a charge, to divide their Dioceſes till they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Congregational Model; much leſs did he ſuggeſt to the People, that they ſhould ſubdivide, ſince their Biſhops would not reſtore the pretended Primitive Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p>I cannot omit one paſſage out of <hi>Chryſostom,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> either miſtook, or was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to pervert to his purpoſe. But as it is cited, it is directly contrary to the ſenſe and

words of the Author;<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Chryſ. in Tit. Or. 1. p. 384.</note>

And therefore <hi>if for friendſhip or other reaſons he ſhall promote an unworthy perſon, and commit to him the care of a great City, how great a flame does he expoſe himſelf to? He is guilty of all the Souls the other ſhall deſtroy, and ſhall be reſponſible for all the things that are acted by him.</hi> Mr. <hi>Clerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> has added here a ſmall word that makes great alteration of the ſenſe, it is <hi>[not]</hi> and hath perverted the whole paſſage from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deiners to the perſons Ordeined; and to make all fit, he is forced to change the words. Had he been to repreſent the danger of thoſe Ordeiners, he would not only have made them reſponſible for the miſcarriages of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Biſhops, but charged upon them as an unpardonable neglect, that they did not Ordein many Biſhops for every great City, ſince one, tho never ſo diligent, muſt be inſufficient for the charge. But this <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> could not think of. For tho he is ſaid to have foretold ſome things, yet the notions of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as well as the Sect, were at too great a diſtance from him to be foreſeen.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to me matter of great aſtoniſhment, to ſee Men pretending to a Conſcience ſo
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:95441:241"/>
nice and ſcrupulous in Religion, to deal with ſo little Faith, and to abuſe the moſt moving and lively eloquence of ancient Preachers, and words as it were of fire, only to make a little falſe light, to abuſe the ignorant and ſimple into a belief, that Novelty is ancient, that Schiſm is Catholick Unity, and that <hi>Chryſost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om,</hi> the great Patriarch of the Imperial City, was in his Principles and deſires an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Lord! How long ſhall mean deluſions be permitted to have ſo powerful and prevailing influence? How long ſhall the Wolf poſſeſs the Sheep againſt their Shepherds, and break into the Folds under the diſguiſe of Sheeps-cloathing? How long ſhall the deluded Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have eys and not ſee; and the Souls, for which Chriſt died, be under the power of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers? How long will it be, ere the Hypocrite be diſrobed; and the People ſee through the diſguiſe of thoſe who abuſe them? Surely there will come a time, when God will hear the Prayers and Expoſtulations of his Servants: When the faithful Shepherd ſhall gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether thoſe that are ſcattered, and bring back thoſe that are gone aſtray: When he ſhall carry them on his ſhoulders rejoycing and triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the diſappointment of the beaſts of prey.

               <p>Upon a ſuppoſition that a Primitive Biſhop had but one Congregation, Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to ſhew, that every Congregation, which is always adequate to a Church in his notion,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:95441:243"/>
had a right of ordering it ſelf, and appointing what rites it thought fit. And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he obſerves out of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen,</hi> that in ſeveral parts of the World there were different uſages and cuſtoms. But is there any inſtance in antiquity of people that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their Biſhop and their own Church, becauſe they would not comply with the cuſtoms and rites received there? For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in <hi>Rome</hi> it was cuſtomary to faſt on Saturday; In other Countries they faſted the day before. Now did any Roman Chriſtian forſake his Church, becauſe they did not faſt on Friday? Or did any <hi>African</hi> part Communion, becauſe the Saturday was not obſerved there as it was in <hi>Rome?</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s judgment in this point is well known, and univerſally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. He directs every Chriſtian to comply with the rites and cuſtoms of the Church where he happens to be, tho he find ſome things dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the uſage of his own Church. The reverence, which the Primitive Chriſtians had for the Forms in which they were brought up, raiſed in them ſome ſcruple, when they came to obſerve thoſe of other Churches to be different. But as to their own particular rites and uſages proper to each reſpective Country, they were ſo peaceably and religiouſly obſerved, that they were never made a pretence of Separation, or ſo much as the occaſion of a Controverſy. Some differences indeed did ariſe very early between Churches of different Countries, about the time of Eaſter, and rebaptizing of Hereticks; but in the concluſion, every one adhered to his own way, which he thought the beſt; and he was
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:95441:243"/>
generally blamed, who took upon him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the reſt. Let us ſuppoſe therefore in this caſe an <hi>African</hi> Chriſtian, who had lived ſome time in <hi>Rome,</hi> and taken a liking to the peculiar uſages of that Church, ſhould after his return home diſparage the received order of his own Church; and to ſhew how much he had improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Travel, indeavour to introduce foreign Cuſtoms: What treatment think you would ſuch a one have received from S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> or S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian?</hi> Such a troubler of the peace and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church would ſoon find himſelf caſt out by the ſevereſt cenſures, unleſs they might think it more adviſable to ſend him to the Exorciſt. This was plainly the caſe between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the firſt Diſſenters. Some of the Engliſh Exiles took I know not what fondneſs to the uſages of ſome Proteſtant Churches abroad, and a ſtrange diſlike to their own way: They returned home with foreign manners, and ſet them up in oppoſition to the order of their own Church, and at laſt parted Communion upon this pretence. It is not here a place to enquire into their reaſons, or to make a compariſon between what they choſe and what they rejected. This only I may be bold to ſay, that their Schiſm is without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, either in ancient or later ages. For who ever ſeparated from the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> in favour of ſome peculiarities he might have ſeen in <hi>Zurich?</hi> Or what <hi>French-Man</hi> forſook the Communion of the French Churches, becauſe they had ſome Ceremonies different from thoſe of <hi>Holland?</hi> Or did a <hi>Hollander</hi> ever run out of the Church, becauſe the Preacher was unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:95441:244"/>
out of pure zeal to the cuſtom of <hi>France,</hi> where the Preacher took the ſame liberty with the Congregation, of being covered too? Our Church does not pretend to preſcribe to any other; nor does ſhe think it reaſonable any other ſhould preſcribe to her: but as all other Churches uſe their diſcretion in appointing what rites they think moſt meet, ſo does ſhe; and is the only Church in the World, that I know, forſaken upon that account. Yet Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi>
                  <note n="(i)" place="bottom">Prim. ep. p. 223.</note> tells us, that we ought to be cautious of <hi>charging one another with Schiſm for ſuch things wherein the ancient Churches are like to be involved in the ſame Condemnation.</hi> As tho <hi>ancient Churches</hi> had any thing parallel to the caſe of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, or indeed any other Church. Sure I am, that the inſtances alledged by Mr. <hi>Clerkſon,</hi> are very wide of it; as I have ſhewed already. For we charge no other Churches with Schiſm, becauſe they have not the ſame rites that we uſe; nor do we ſo much as condemn the Diſſenters upon that account. But in this we charge them with Schiſm, that they have departed from the Communion of our Church upon the account of rites; and they indeed condemning us by their Separation upon that reaſon, do truly <hi>involve the ancient Churches in the ſame condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make the end anſwer the beginning, Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi> concludes with a manifeſt calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. <hi>Hereby,</hi> ſays he,<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Prim. ep. p. 226.</note>

<pb n="449" facs="tcp:95441:244"/>
judgment and charity ſome among us will have none to be true Churches, that want Dioceſan Biſhops; —they hereby blast all the Churches in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times and the beſt Ages after, as no Churches.—Herein they are as wiſe and friendly, as if one to ſecure the height of his own Turret, ſhould attempt to blow up all the Houſes in the best part of the world; nay they blow up their own too.</hi> It is neither <hi>wiſe nor friendly</hi> to charge men with abſurd opinions, of which neither they, nor perhaps any other were ever guilty. What witneſs, what evidence of this matter? What Books or converſation ever betrayed ſo great a weakneſs? I never yet heard of any man, who made it eſſential to a Biſhop to have many Congregations under them. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have ſeveral Biſhops with a very ſmall flock, and ſuch as one Pariſh-Church may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. They have others who have not ſo much as one Congregation, nor perhaps one Chriſtian within their Dioceſe. But we may gueſs at the men our Author intends; they indeed diſtinguiſh, with all the ancient Churches, between a Biſhop and a Presbyter: But for the meaſure of Epiſcopal Churches, They willingly ſubſcribe to S. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s<note n="(m)" place="bottom">Ep. ad Evagr.</note> judgment, that the Biſhop of <hi>Eugubium</hi> is no leſs a Biſhop than he of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Tanis</hi> is as much a Biſhop as he of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> ſince it is not the greatneſs of the City, but the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, that makes a Biſhop.

<pb n="450" facs="tcp:95441:245"/>
times and thoſe next ſucceeding, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Dioceſes were very different. In <hi>Scythia</hi>
                  <note n="(n)" place="bottom">Soz. l. 7. c. 19.</note> there was but one, though many Cities; and in ſome places there were Biſhops in Villages. Some Cities had very large Territories belonging to their Biſhops, others but ſmall; yet all this while, theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops accounted themſelves all of equal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, though their Dioceſes might be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal; and never broke Communion upon that account.

that makes a Biſhop, but the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For a Presbyter may be the Paſtor of a Congregation, and in the Primitive times there were many ſuch; but this does not make him a Biſhop. Nay, the <hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi> were Paſtors of many Congregations, and yet theſe were not Biſhops. If theſe in ancient times ſhould have proceeded upon Mr. <hi>Clerkſon</hi>'s grounds, and preſumed to ordain Presbyters or Deacons or Biſhops; the Church of thoſe times would have made no difficulty to pronounce the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations null. <hi>Iſchyras</hi> pretended to be a Presbyter, becauſe <hi>Colluthus</hi> had ordained him; but <hi>Athanaſius</hi> repreſents it as monſtrous, that one ſhould eſteem himſelf a Presbyter, who was ordained by one who died himſelf a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter of the Church of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Nor was <hi>Iſchyras</hi> ſo abſurd as to think, that the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation received from a ſimple Presbyter would be valid. For in Truth, that <hi>Colluthus</hi> was made a Biſhop by <hi>Meletius,</hi> and his name is ſtill in the Catalogue of his Ordinations; but renouncing his Schiſm, and thoſe Orders, he was received into communion as Presbyter; for ſo he was before he joyned with <hi>Meletius,</hi> and in that degree he died. Nor can I find in all Antiquity, any one inſtance of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters making Ordinations without a Biſhop: nay, the Hereticks and Schiſmaticks of old, among all their irregularities, are not charged by any of this preſumption. In the Dioceſe of <hi>Alexandria</hi> there were many Presbyters, who were the Paſtors of ſingle Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and ſo it was in moſt of the ancient Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes, as we have ſhewed before. In the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:95441:246"/>
of <hi>Scythia,</hi> there muſt be yet a greater number of ſuch Pariſh Paſtors. Yet none of theſe are found to have claimed any right to ordain: and if any of them ſhould have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed againſt the rule of the Church in that particular, the Church of thoſe times would not only have declared the Ordination null, but a prodigy, and think that Antichriſt was at hand, and the world drawing towards an end, when ſuch new and unexampled confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were permitted to ariſe. What ſentence ſhall we think, would they have pronounced upon Presbyterian Ordinations, when they did not ſtick<note n="(s)" place="bottom">Can. Nic. 9, 10, 16. Can. Ant. 73.</note> to reſcind Orders conferred by Biſhops againſt the Canons and eſtabliſhed diſcipline of the Church; and in ſome caſes to<note n="(t)" place="bottom">Nic. Can. 19.</note> re-ordain? <hi>Aerius,</hi> who declared there was no difference between a Biſhop and a Presbyter, is repreſented by <hi>Epiphanius</hi>

               <p>But the caſe of the Ordinations of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters is peculiar; and they do forreign Churches great wrong, when they concern them in their quarrel. For firſt, the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents have no root of Orders, but their Paſtors are of Lay Original extraction. The Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians have Ordination from Presbyters, not only without, but in oppoſition to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:95441:247"/>
againſt all the eſtabliſhed rules of this Church, againſt the Laws of the Country, as well as practice of ancient Churches. And if upon this account we pronounce them void, we do no more than what all the Proteſtant Churches abroad would do in the like caſe. If ſome Deacons or Lay-men would take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to ordain Paſtors in the <hi>French</hi> Churches, for ſeparate Congregations, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the received diſcipline, ſetled in their general Synods; I would appeal to any Miniſter of thoſe Churches, whether he held ſuch an Ordination valid. And yet by the principles of thoſe Churches, Lay-men may confer orders in ſome caſes, as appears<note n="(x)" place="bottom">Hiſt. Eccleſ. T. 1. l. 2.</note> by the firſt Ordination in <hi>Paris,</hi> where there was no Presbyter preſent; and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>Beza</hi>
                  <note n="(y)" place="bottom">Hiſt. Eccleſ. T. 1. l. 4.</note> in the Conference of <hi>Poiſſy.</hi> Nay though a Presbyter depoſed by their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, ſhould take upon him to ordain; I ſtill appeal to the Miniſters of thoſe Churches, whether they would account the Orders valid. If we therefore <hi>do judge ſuch Ordinations here, to be nullities,</hi> becauſe adminiſtred by ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Officers, againſt the Laws of the Church, in oppoſition to their ſuperiours, and againſt the practice and diſcipline of the Primitive Chriſtians; we cannot be thought ſingular in this judgment: ſince all ancient Churches would have done the ſame thing, and all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> in the like caſe, would
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:95441:247"/>
follow our example. It is in vain to cite <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> to leſſen the difference between a Biſhop and a Presbyter, becauſe both may do almoſt all the ſame things. Yet is Ordination ſtill excepted, and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the peculiar prerogative of the Biſhop. And though in ſome Churches, Presbyters did aſſiſt the Biſhop in ordaining Presbyters, which is likewiſe the practice of our Church; yet is there no inſtance of their ordaining without a Biſhop.</p>
